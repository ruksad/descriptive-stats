        "# Project: Learning to Label – From Clustering to Classification\n",
        "In the real world, data rarely comes with clean labels. As a machine learning engineer at a data-centric company, you’re handed fairly large, unlabelled datasets across two domains—images and text. Your team is tasked with building a functional classification system, but without labeled training data, the first challenge is to create your own labels. Welcome to your mission: learning to label intelligently and building robust classifiers from scratch."

EDT\n\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that \nOctavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today \nabout why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to \nget a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature \nof learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of \npeople like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of \nthose who are here.  \n\t     \n\t     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education \nand all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my \ngood friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and \nall of the business and local community leaders from the city and \ncounty and state level from around America who are here. \n\t     \n\t     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved \nhearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is \ntheir future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A \nyear and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because \nI was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our \ncountry, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had \ntoo little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines \nof income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to \ntake us into the future.  \n\t     \n\t     I entered with the hope that together we could create \nmore opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of \nour people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of \nAmerica's community, knowing that together we could always to more \nthan we could individually and that we might secure our future.\n\t     \n\t     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 \njobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the \ncommitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, \nand those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs \ndoes, and the successes of all the young people like those on this \nstage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all \nthose things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're \non the right track.\n\t     \n\t     Last July when I was traveling across America's \nheartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in \nLouisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business \npeople who were participating in the Louisville Education and \nEmployment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  \nI saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed \nboth in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my \nown state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about \n-- that for millions of American young people it is really an \nimpediment to both their learning and their ability to be good \nworkers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what \nis learning.\n\t     \n\t     In the world in which we are living, the average young \nperson will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a \nlifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning \nworld much better.  And we must determine that all of our young \npeople see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased \nhere today.  \n\t     \n\t     Whether you're in business or in government or in \neducation, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to \nbuilding a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all \nof our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things \nare pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best \nthing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have \njobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  \n\t     \n\t     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty \ngood education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that \nthey'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either \npolitical or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great \nchallenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to \nfully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work \nfor them to do.\n\t     \n\t     All the European countries have higher unemployment \nrates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the \nunemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  \nThey're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its \nmost rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that \nI have proposed to create jobs. \n\t     \n\t     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now \nabout as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  \nIt costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of \npressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing \ntheir own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their \npeople.  \n\t     \n\t     But it is especially important for America for two \nreasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move \naggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be \ncompetitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, \neven if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed \nof the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to \nwork in this country.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some \nof it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and \nmoving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We \nhave now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big \norganizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they \nare organized and who ask whether there are too many people working \nat some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to \ncreate jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the \nchance to work.  \n\t     \n\t     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare \nreform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of \nmonths -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the \nend of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of \nthe American people to perform without regard to race or income or \nthe circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that \nthere are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their \ntalent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  \nI do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if \nyou want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more \nresponsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this \ncountry that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you \nhave got to have opportunity in that mix. \n\t     \n\t     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for \nevery young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules \nand work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be \nsomething at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are \nbasically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, \nrecognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of \nour people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their \nbackground.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's \nsomething there for them to do?\n\n\t     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an \nintegral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of \nwork and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people \nfirst, and it does have a partnership between the public and private \nsector.\n\t     \n\t     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in \nFebruary on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 \nextra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the \nAmerican business community to meet that target so that we can create  \nmore than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been \ncreated before.\n\t     \n\t     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And \nJerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in \nthis room and around the country -- people who are going to do more \nthan they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people \na work experience.  And it is terribly important.\n\t     \n\t     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is \npart of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the \nAmerican people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their \njobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving \nthe transition from school to work for young people who don't go to \ncollege but do need at least two years of post-high school training \neither on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, \nso that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more \npeople to go on to college who do want to go.\n\t     \n\t     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive \nplan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The \nemergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would \ncreate a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and \nthat would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It \nwould also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work \nforce in jobs that otherwise will not be created.\n\t     \n\t      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to \ninvest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --\nprojects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, \nnew industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities \n-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve \nthe environment.  \n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs program is an important part of that \nbecause we have tried for the first time, through the work of the \nLabor Department and the Education Department and through reaching \nout to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer \njobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to \nhopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young \npeople into further educational opportunities and to further job \nopportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component \nto these summer jobs -- something that the United States government \nhas never fully emphasized before.  \n\t     \n\t     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because \nthey come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in \ndifficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building \ntheir basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other \nareas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who \nhave difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what \nthey learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next \nyear.  \n\t     \n\t     What we are trying to do here is to give people the \nopportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning \nskills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next \ncouple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school \nin this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning \nenvironment.  \n\t     \n\t     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities \nfor people to learn and work during the school year, so that this \nwill not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will \nbe a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new \nwork experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.\n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-\nwork jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding \nthe job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help \nto build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve \nlocal problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public \nbuildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in \nhospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, \nand learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while \nthey earn, but letting them earn.\n\t     \n\t     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people \nwho have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should \ndo this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the \nopportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing \nin going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't \nexactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare \nsystem; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people \nto work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the \nuse of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if \nyou're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to \nreward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     The young people we propose to put to work under our \nprogram will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, \nreading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will \nstretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a \nsense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, \nbut a challenge that will take them into a different life.\n\t     \n\t     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even \nas I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the \nsummer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll \nsee whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer \nacademically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved \nahead.  I suspect that they will.  \n\t     \n\t     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I \nwill be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn \nfrom you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next \nsummer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school \nyear, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that \nwe do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so \nthat we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private \ninvestments as well. \n\t     \n\t     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the \nbusiness leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this \nsummer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business \nwho have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who \nhaven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about \nthis event today, I want to implore other private employers to \nstretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this \nsummer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when \nwe don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort \nthem to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up \nhere on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking \nabout work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've \ndone to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very \nfoolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand \nand sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had \never had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be \nworth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     That does not mean young people should not be \nentrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation \nahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and \nworked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  \nAnd I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some \npeople say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  \n\t     \n\t     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I \ngrew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul \nwithout regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a \njob.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to \npeople is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a \njob and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now \nI live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any \nmore money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're \nworking longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  \nAnd we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these \nyoung people want.\n\t     \n\t     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  \nIt doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration \npursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private \nsector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn \nhow to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created \nin this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done \noff-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a \nthird or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do \neconomically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of \nAmerica's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just \nkidding.  \n\t     \n\t     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy \ncountry in the world, including the United States, is having \ndifficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done \nI'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole \ndeliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the \nanswers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     And so the jobs program that I have presented to \nCongress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the \ncounties, through the Community Development Program, with the \ninfrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an \nattempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the \neconomy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little \nboost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a \nmillion jobs and maybe get the engine going again.\n\t     \n\t     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in \nthe private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government \nmoney.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American \neconomy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind \nof system we have and it works pretty well.  \n\t     \n\t     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you \nhere today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends \nand neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers \nto make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the \nfunds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government \nshould create this summer, so that together we can have this \npartnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a \nfuture -- a future that our young people can believe in.  \n\t     \n\t     We need to send them a message that here in America if \nyou study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute \nsomething to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  \nYou can build a future from you own dreams. \n\t     \n\t     That has always been the promise of America.  Together \nthat's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of \nthe promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise \nhas been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.\n\t     \n\t     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\n\n                                 END11:45 A.M. EDT\n\n\n\n",

That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,\n   but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing\n   military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than\n   just a \"we have the money, why not?\" approach.\n\nAh, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not\nwasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) bills\nto fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be\nspent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of funding\nhigh-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various\nfields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the\ndefense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to\nfund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-European\ncooperation.\n\nNow maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of\nmoney (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as\ninvestment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at\nthe size of that multiplier :->).\n\nNick Haines nickh@cmu.edu\n",

I don't\n>have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:\n>\n>[...]  Any stories on how you all learned?\n\nI'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.\n\nEarly in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on\nhis old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I\nactually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.\n\nI proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and\nrode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to\ninvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then\nI also passed my road test.\n\nOn May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a\n4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),\nI had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,\nskidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the\noncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was\nalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under\na car and been killed.\n\nNow this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the\nExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training\ncould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater\nsince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff\nas I did.\n\nSo my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I\nwouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you\nhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until\nyou're ready to use it.\n\n>1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have \n>to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too \n>ignorant to know I need to buy)\n\nWhile you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in\nDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you\nsave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,\nplus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure\nthe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up\nmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration\nand licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not\nincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.\n\n>2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in \n>about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up\n>till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a \n>motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes\n>a difference)\n\nI pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200\nin Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial\ncoverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be\npoor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo\nmore expensive.\n\n>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?\n\nThere used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle\nmagazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or\nrecent models might be available.  You could probably look through\npast issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first\nbike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice\ninstead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that\nare parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by\nnoticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around\nand they were generally set up the way I wanted.\n\nNothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting\nshowrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,\nwere very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and\nquoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence\ncheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.\n\n-- David Karr (karr@cs.cornell.edu)\n-- '80 BMW R65   DoD #0969   also BMWMOA, NRA, ACLU, et al.\n\n\n",

No cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look \nvery clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. All \nstill within factory specs.

Meaning: would gases \"so far\" down the line (the canister)\n>really have an effect on the exhaust stroke?  Do the gases really \n>compress that much?\n\n    For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses\nin the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.\n\n1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force\nair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake\nvalve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only\nthe difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after\nthe exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the\nintake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing\natmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time\ndoes the pressure ever become \"negative\", or even approach a good\nvacuum.\n\n2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the\ncombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up\nto the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume\nof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume\nthat must flow through the intake, because of the temperature\ndifference and the products of combustion.\n\n3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started\npaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty\nhorsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,\nsubstitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost\nzero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very\nwell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make\nvery little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is\n_much_ louder than the stocker.\n\n4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.\nIf free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference\nwas noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.\n\n5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any\ngiven RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it\non the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.\nPumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| Dave Tharp                      | DoD #0751   | \"You can't wear out       |\n| davet@interceptor.CDS.TEK.COM   | MRA #151    |   an Indian Scout,        |\n| '88 K75S  '48 Indian Chief      | AHRMA #751  |  Or its brother the Chief.|\n| '75 R90S(#151) '72 TR-2B(#751)  | AMA #524737 |  They're built like rocks |\n| '65 R50/2/Velorex  '57 NSU Max  |             |   to take the knocks,     |\n|       1936 BMW R12              | (Compulsive | It's the Harleys that     |\n| My employer has no idea.        |   Joiner)   |   give you grief.\"        |\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

EDT\n             \n             \n             THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  My voice is coming to\nyou this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio\nstation in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to\nmeet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,\nhealth care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly\nbroadcast with the American people. \n             \n             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when\nit reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past\nseven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with\nthe people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus\ntour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last\nyear's campaign.\n             \n             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with\nyou, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and\nwhat I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting\nto you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.\n             \n             You sent me to Washington to get our government and\neconomy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad\nexperiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important\nit is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do\nbusiness.  \n             \n             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations\nrise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness\nof their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the\ncooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,\nlabor and government.  Although many of the economies of the\nindustrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've\nmade many of the smart investments and the tough choices which\nour government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them\nhave been moving ahead and too many of our people have been\nfalling behind.\n             \n             We have an economy today that even when it grows is\nnot producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation\nby four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to\nshow for it.  We know that wages of most working people have\nstopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks\nand that too many families can no longer afford the escalating\ncost of health care.\n             \n             But we also know that, given the right tools, the\nright incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and\nbusinesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy\nneeds to expand opportunity and to make our communities better\nplaces to live.\n             \n             In many critical products today Americans are the\nlow cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that\nwe create more of those kinds of jobs.\n             \n             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for\nlong-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old\npriorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to\nbe -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs\nand education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the\nwaste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious\nresources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the\ngroundwork for robust economic growth in the future.\n             \n             These new directions passed the Congress in record\ntime and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our\ncountry.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would\ncreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private\nsector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It\nnow has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. \nBut it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the\nSenate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know\nwould result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.\n             \n             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. \nMillions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and\ncounting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill\nhas been grounded by gridlock.  \n             \n             I know the American people are tired of business as\nusual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin\nor wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have\ntaken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra\nmile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25\npercent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  \n             \n             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million\nAmericans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill\nlanguish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean\nhundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to\nact to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking\nthis initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I\nthink we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant\nportion of our original goals.\n             \n             First, we want to keep the programs as much as\npossible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,\nincluding highway and road construction, summer jobs for young\npeople, immunization for children, construction of waste water\nsites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding\nfor extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who\nhave been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't\ncreating jobs.\n             \n             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs\nin the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40\npercent.\n             \n             And third, I've recommended a new element in this\nprogram to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against\ncrime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire\npolice officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put\nthem back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight\nfor a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it\nand deserve it.\n             \n             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --\nthe Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it\nincreases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this\nyear that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,\ndoesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more\nthan paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this\nbudget is well within the spending limits already approved by the\nCongress this year.\n             \n             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators\nwho are filibustering the bill voted during the previous\nadministration for billions of dollars of the same kind of\nemergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the\nAmerican people to work.  \n             \n             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered\na plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities\nare -- on people or on politics.  \n             \n             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar\nfor dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the\nsoundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our\nchildren.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs\nand investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of\nus when we've helped make more American partners working to\nensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.\n             \n             You know, if every American who wanted a job had\none, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this\ncountry today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first\nstep to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country\nagain.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid\nfor over the life of our budget.\n             \n             Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how\nimportant the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.\n             \n             Good morning, and thank you for listening.\n\n                               END                 10:11 A.M. EDT\n\n\n\n",

He must have been abused by a man and is\n] living his life in an attempt to vilify all men who like sex with other men\n] something slightly similar to the way his assailant liked it with him. He\n] will alter or misrepresent anything he finds to try to prove that there are\n] homosexuals who wish to rape little boys like he was coming out of the\n] woodwork. There is no hope for him. In all probability he is secretly gay,\n] which compounds his neurosis in his own mind, by thinking that someone else\n] made him that way. I don't personally see how someone like him could walk\n] and chew gum at the same time, as mentally crippled and dominated as he is\n] by his fantasies.\n] \n] He would have you believe that the figures on the percentage of people who\n] like to do it with the same sex sometime or all the time is way smaller\n] than it is, but then he will virtually assert that everyone's queer and\n] they're trying to get him. He actually believes, despite all evidence that\n] homosexuals do some huge disproportionate amount of child sexual abuse,\n] even though he insists that there may be as few as 1% of them in the male\n] population! If there were that few of them in the population, San Francisco\n] would currently be empty, because a significant portion of them have sought\n] a tolerant atmosphere in that city, and the numbers simply do not work when\n] you add up their home town origins. There is nothing to be gained by\n] communicating with Clayton Cramer, he is unable to listen to anyone.\n] -RSW\n] \n] \n] --\n] * Richard STEVEn Walz   rstevew@deeptht.armory.com   (408) 429-1200  *\n] * 515 Maple Street #1   * Without safe and free abortion women are   *\n] * Santa Cruz, CA 95060    organ-surrogates to unwanted parasites.*   *\n] * Real Men would never accept organ-slavery and will protect Women.  *\n\nSorry, but I don't see how the response applies to what was posted.\n\nUnless I am badly mistaken, Rohit is suggesting that protecting boys\nfrom men is different than protecting girls from men. There are situations\nin which boys and girls are apart from members of the *opposite* sex\n(due to social convention or whatever) and thus are safe (in at least\nsome sense). These same situations don't (necessarily) protect the\nchildren from abuse by members of the *same* sex.\n\nIf we can understand that, it's not such a tremendous leap to suggest\nthat if we all think about it hard, *someone* may come up with a\npractical solution (or even a partial solution) to some of the situations\nin which children are made vulnerable to homosexuals who wish to abuse\nthem. By working together \"with good will on both sides\", we may be\nable to start solving problems without restricting anyone's freedoms.\n\nMr. Walz on the other hand is using Rohit's post as an excuse for\npersonal attacks on Mr. Cramer. While Mr. Walz hasn't (by a *long*\nstretch) been the only one to flame Mr. Cramer, it is no less childish\nand it only serves to weaken any other arguments he may make in the\nfuture.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nRick Roy       Usenet: rick@howtek.MV.com       America Online: QED\nDisclaimer: My employer's views are orthogonal to these.\nThe early bird got worms.\n",

The orbital trajectory for Comet\nShoemaker-Levy is still being determined.\n     ___    _____     ___\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\n    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | Being cynical never helps \n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | to correct the situation \n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | and causes more aggravation\n                                                  | instead.\n",

EDT\n\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that \nOctavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today \nabout why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to \nget a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature \nof learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of \npeople like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of \nthose who are here.  \n\t     \n\t     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education \nand all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my \ngood friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and \nall of the business and local community leaders from the city and \ncounty and state level from around America who are here. \n\t     \n\t     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved \nhearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is \ntheir future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A \nyear and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because \nI was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our \ncountry, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had \ntoo little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines \nof income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to \ntake us into the future.  \n\t     \n\t     I entered with the hope that together we could create \nmore opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of \nour people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of \nAmerica's community, knowing that together we could always to more \nthan we could individually and that we might secure our future.\n\t     \n\t     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 \njobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the \ncommitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, \nand those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs \ndoes, and the successes of all the young people like those on this \nstage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all \nthose things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're \non the right track.\n\t     \n\t     Last July when I was traveling across America's \nheartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in \nLouisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business \npeople who were participating in the Louisville Education and \nEmployment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  \nI saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed \nboth in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my \nown state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about \n-- that for millions of American young people it is really an \nimpediment to both their learning and their ability to be good \nworkers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what \nis learning.\n\t     \n\t     In the world in which we are living, the average young \nperson will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a \nlifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning \nworld much better.  And we must determine that all of our young \npeople see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased \nhere today.  \n\t     \n\t     Whether you're in business or in government or in \neducation, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to \nbuilding a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all \nof our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things \nare pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best \nthing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have \njobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  \n\t     \n\t     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty \ngood education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that \nthey'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either \npolitical or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great \nchallenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to \nfully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work \nfor them to do.\n\t     \n\t     All the European countries have higher unemployment \nrates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the \nunemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  \nThey're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its \nmost rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that \nI have proposed to create jobs. \n\t     \n\t     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now \nabout as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  \nIt costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of \npressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing \ntheir own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their \npeople.  \n\t     \n\t     But it is especially important for America for two \nreasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move \naggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be \ncompetitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, \neven if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed \nof the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to \nwork in this country.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some \nof it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and \nmoving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We \nhave now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big \norganizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they \nare organized and who ask whether there are too many people working \nat some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to \ncreate jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the \nchance to work.  \n\t     \n\t     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare \nreform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of \nmonths -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the \nend of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of \nthe American people to perform without regard to race or income or \nthe circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that \nthere are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their \ntalent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  \nI do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if \nyou want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more \nresponsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this \ncountry that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you \nhave got to have opportunity in that mix. \n\t     \n\t     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for \nevery young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules \nand work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be \nsomething at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are \nbasically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, \nrecognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of \nour people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their \nbackground.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's \nsomething there for them to do?\n\n\t     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an \nintegral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of \nwork and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people \nfirst, and it does have a partnership between the public and private \nsector.\n\t     \n\t     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in \nFebruary on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 \nextra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the \nAmerican business community to meet that target so that we can create  \nmore than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been \ncreated before.\n\t     \n\t     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And \nJerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in \nthis room and around the country -- people who are going to do more \nthan they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people \na work experience.  And it is terribly important.\n\t     \n\t     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is \npart of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the \nAmerican people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their \njobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving \nthe transition from school to work for young people who don't go to \ncollege but do need at least two years of post-high school training \neither on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, \nso that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more \npeople to go on to college who do want to go.\n\t     \n\t     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive \nplan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The \nemergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would \ncreate a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and \nthat would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It \nwould also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work \nforce in jobs that otherwise will not be created.\n\t     \n\t      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to \ninvest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --\nprojects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, \nnew industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities \n-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve \nthe environment.  \n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs program is an important part of that \nbecause we have tried for the first time, through the work of the \nLabor Department and the Education Department and through reaching \nout to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer \njobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to \nhopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young \npeople into further educational opportunities and to further job \nopportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component \nto these summer jobs -- something that the United States government \nhas never fully emphasized before.  \n\t     \n\t     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because \nthey come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in \ndifficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building \ntheir basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other \nareas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who \nhave difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what \nthey learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next \nyear.  \n\t     \n\t     What we are trying to do here is to give people the \nopportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning \nskills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next \ncouple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school \nin this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning \nenvironment.  \n\t     \n\t     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities \nfor people to learn and work during the school year, so that this \nwill not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will \nbe a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new \nwork experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.\n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-\nwork jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding \nthe job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help \nto build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve \nlocal problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public \nbuildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in \nhospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, \nand learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while \nthey earn, but letting them earn.\n\t     \n\t     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people \nwho have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should \ndo this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the \nopportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing \nin going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't \nexactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare \nsystem; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people \nto work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the \nuse of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if \nyou're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to \nreward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     The young people we propose to put to work under our \nprogram will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, \nreading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will \nstretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a \nsense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, \nbut a challenge that will take them into a different life.\n\t     \n\t     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even \nas I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the \nsummer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll \nsee whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer \nacademically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved \nahead.  I suspect that they will.  \n\t     \n\t     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I \nwill be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn \nfrom you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next \nsummer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school \nyear, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that \nwe do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so \nthat we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private \ninvestments as well. \n\t     \n\t     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the \nbusiness leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this \nsummer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business \nwho have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who \nhaven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about \nthis event today, I want to implore other private employers to \nstretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this \nsummer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when \nwe don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort \nthem to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up \nhere on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking \nabout work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've \ndone to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very \nfoolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand \nand sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had \never had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be \nworth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     That does not mean young people should not be \nentrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation \nahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and \nworked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  \nAnd I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some \npeople say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  \n\t     \n\t     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I \ngrew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul \nwithout regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a \njob.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to \npeople is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a \njob and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now \nI live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any \nmore money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're \nworking longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  \nAnd we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these \nyoung people want.\n\t     \n\t     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  \nIt doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration \npursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private \nsector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn \nhow to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created \nin this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done \noff-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a \nthird or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do \neconomically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of \nAmerica's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just \nkidding.  \n\t     \n\t     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy \ncountry in the world, including the United States, is having \ndifficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done \nI'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole \ndeliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the \nanswers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     And so the jobs program that I have presented to \nCongress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the \ncounties, through the Community Development Program, with the \ninfrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an \nattempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the \neconomy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little \nboost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a \nmillion jobs and maybe get the engine going again.\n\t     \n\t     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in \nthe private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government \nmoney.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American \neconomy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind \nof system we have and it works pretty well.  \n\t     \n\t     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you \nhere today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends \nand neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers \nto make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the \nfunds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government \nshould create this summer, so that together we can have this \npartnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a \nfuture -- a future that our young people can believe in.  \n\t     \n\t     We need to send them a message that here in America if \nyou study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute \nsomething to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  \nYou can build a future from you own dreams. \n\t     \n\t     That has always been the promise of America.  Together \nthat's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of \nthe promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise \nhas been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.\n\t     \n\t     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\n\n                                 END11:45 A.M. EDT\n\n\n\n",

That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,\n   but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing\n   military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than\n   just a \"we have the money, why not?\" approach.\n\nAh, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not\nwasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) bills\nto fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be\nspent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of funding\nhigh-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various\nfields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the\ndefense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to\nfund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-European\ncooperation.\n\nNow maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of\nmoney (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as\ninvestment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at\nthe size of that multiplier :->).\n\nNick Haines nickh@cmu.edu\n",

I don't\n>have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:\n>\n>[...]  Any stories on how you all learned?\n\nI'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.\n\nEarly in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on\nhis old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I\nactually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.\n\nI proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and\nrode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to\ninvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then\nI also passed my road test.\n\nOn May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a\n4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),\nI had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,\nskidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the\noncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was\nalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under\na car and been killed.\n\nNow this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the\nExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training\ncould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater\nsince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff\nas I did.\n\nSo my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I\nwouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you\nhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until\nyou're ready to use it.\n\n>1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have \n>to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too \n>ignorant to know I need to buy)\n\nWhile you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in\nDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you\nsave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,\nplus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure\nthe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up\nmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration\nand licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not\nincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.\n\n>2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in \n>about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up\n>till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a \n>motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes\n>a difference)\n\nI pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200\nin Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial\ncoverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be\npoor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo\nmore expensive.\n\n>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?\n\nThere used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle\nmagazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or\nrecent models might be available.  You could probably look through\npast issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first\nbike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice\ninstead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that\nare parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by\nnoticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around\nand they were generally set up the way I wanted.\n\nNothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting\nshowrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,\nwere very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and\nquoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence\ncheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.\n\n-- David Karr (karr@cs.cornell.edu)\n-- '80 BMW R65   DoD #0969   also BMWMOA, NRA, ACLU, et al.\n\n\n",

Speaking from personal\nexperience, I have had judges illegally assume jurisdiction even after\nI demanded that the DA prove such jurisdiction on the record, and the\nDA stood mute.  I have also had an appellate court uphold such action\nand hide behind California Rules of Court, Rule 106 (\"The judges of\nthe appellate department shall not be required to write opinions in\nany cases decided by them, but may do so whenever they deem it\nadvisable or in the public interest.\").

                  "Organization: University of Waterloo\n\nHi, I just have a small question about my bike. \nBeing a fairly experienced BMW and MZ-Mechanic, I just don't know what to \nthink about my Honda. \nShe was using too much oil for the last 5000 km (on my trip to Daytona bike \nweek this spring), and all of a sudden, she trailed smoke like hell and \nwas running only on one cylinder. \nI towed the bike home and took it apart, but everything looks in perfect \nworking order. No cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look \nvery clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. All \nstill within factory specs. The only thing I could find, however, was a \nslightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder (the one with the problem), \nbut it is still way below the wear-limit given in the Clymer-manual for \nthis bike. \nAny syggestions??? What else could cause my problem??? Do I have to hone \nthe cylinder walls (make them a little rougher in a criss-cross-pattern) in \norder to get better breaking in of my new rings??? Won't that increase the \nwear of my pistons??\nPlease send comments to \n\tsruhl@mechanical.watstar.uwaterloo.ca\nThanks in advance. Stef. \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \nStefan Ruhl \ngerman exchange student. \nDon't poke into my privacy ! \n",

I was doing research on subliminal suggestion for a psychology\npaper, and I read that one researcher flashed hidden messages on the\nTV screen at 1/200ths of a second.  Is that possible?  I thought the\nmaximum rate the TV was even capable of displaying images was 1/30th\nof a second.  (or 1/60th of a second for an image composed of only odd\nor even scan lines)\n\n- Rich\n  kennehra@logic.camp.clarkson.edu\n",

I hear that they're called\n>'Cooling Towers' but what the heck do they cool?\n>I hope someone can help \n\n\nThe actual hourglass is hollow and is designed to generate a draft,\nexploiting the venturi effect.  Around the base of the hourglass is a\nring of water towers.  Warm river water, coming from the steam condenser\nin the plant, is sprayed over louvres.  The draft being pulled through\nthe tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection.  The\nsensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for\ndraft generation.\n\nIt should be noted that the hourglass-shaped cooling towers are used on\nboth fossile and nuclear plants.  It should also be noted that at \nlocations where water is plentiful, the cooling towers are only used part\ntime, when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit.\nIt was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish.\nFishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect.  Nontheless, stringent,\nusually state, regulations remain in some instances.  Since it typically\ntakes 60,000 hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed \nto cool a 1000 MWe plant, the cost of using the towers is not insignificant.\n-- \nJohn De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?  \nPerformance Engineering Magazine(TM) | Interested in high tech and computers? \nMarietta, Ga                         | Send ur snail-mail address to \njgd@dixie.com                        | perform@dixie.com for a free sample mag\nLee Harvey Oswald: Where are ya when we need ya?\n",

Do the gases really \n>compress that much?\n\n    For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses\nin the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.\n\n1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force\nair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake\nvalve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only\nthe difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after\nthe exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the\nintake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing\natmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time\ndoes the pressure ever become \"negative\", or even approach a good\nvacuum.\n\n2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the\ncombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up\nto the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume\nof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume\nthat must flow through the intake, because of the temperature\ndifference and the products of combustion.\n\n3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started\npaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty\nhorsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,\nsubstitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost\nzero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very\nwell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make\nvery little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is\n_much_ louder than the stocker.\n\n4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.\nIf free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference\nwas noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.\n\n5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any\ngiven RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it\non the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.\nPumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| Dave Tharp                      | DoD #0751   | \"You can't wear out       |\n| davet@interceptor.CDS.TEK.COM   | MRA #151    |   an Indian Scout,        |\n| '88 K75S  '48 Indian Chief      | AHRMA #751  |  Or its brother the Chief.|\n| '75 R90S(#151) '72 TR-2B(#751)  | AMA #524737 |  They're built like rocks |\n| '65 R50/2/Velorex  '57 NSU Max  |             |   to take the knocks,     |\n|       1936 BMW R12              | (Compulsive | It's the Harleys that     |\n| My employer has no idea.        |   Joiner)   |   give you grief.\"        |\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

Ideally, something that is geared toward \nhobbyists:  small quantity, mail order, etc.\n\nFor years, we've been buying them from a distributor (Marshall) by the\nhundreds for PMP kits.  But orders have dropped to the point where we can\nno longer afford to offer this service.  And all of the distributors I've\nchecked have some crazy minimum order ($100, or so).\n\nI'd like to find a source for those still interested in building PMP kits.\nAny suggestions?\n\n-- \nAndrew C.

EDT\n             \n             \n             THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  My voice is coming to\nyou this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio\nstation in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to\nmeet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,\nhealth care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly\nbroadcast with the American people. \n             \n             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when\nit reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past\nseven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with\nthe people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus\ntour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last\nyear's campaign.\n             \n             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with\nyou, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and\nwhat I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting\nto you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.\n             \n             You sent me to Washington to get our government and\neconomy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad\nexperiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important\nit is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do\nbusiness.  \n             \n             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations\nrise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness\nof their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the\ncooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,\nlabor and government.  Although many of the economies of the\nindustrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've\nmade many of the smart investments and the tough choices which\nour government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them\nhave been moving ahead and too many of our people have been\nfalling behind.\n             \n             We have an economy today that even when it grows is\nnot producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation\nby four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to\nshow for it.  We know that wages of most working people have\nstopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks\nand that too many families can no longer afford the escalating\ncost of health care.\n             \n             But we also know that, given the right tools, the\nright incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and\nbusinesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy\nneeds to expand opportunity and to make our communities better\nplaces to live.\n             \n             In many critical products today Americans are the\nlow cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that\nwe create more of those kinds of jobs.\n             \n             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for\nlong-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old\npriorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to\nbe -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs\nand education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the\nwaste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious\nresources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the\ngroundwork for robust economic growth in the future.\n             \n             These new directions passed the Congress in record\ntime and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our\ncountry.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would\ncreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private\nsector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It\nnow has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. \nBut it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the\nSenate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know\nwould result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.\n             \n             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. \nMillions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and\ncounting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill\nhas been grounded by gridlock.  \n             \n             I know the American people are tired of business as\nusual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin\nor wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have\ntaken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra\nmile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25\npercent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  \n             \n             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million\nAmericans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill\nlanguish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean\nhundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to\nact to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking\nthis initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I\nthink we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant\nportion of our original goals.\n             \n             First, we want to keep the programs as much as\npossible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,\nincluding highway and road construction, summer jobs for young\npeople, immunization for children, construction of waste water\nsites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding\nfor extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who\nhave been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't\ncreating jobs.\n             \n             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs\nin the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40\npercent.\n             \n             And third, I've recommended a new element in this\nprogram to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against\ncrime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire\npolice officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put\nthem back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight\nfor a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it\nand deserve it.\n             \n             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --\nthe Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it\nincreases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this\nyear that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,\ndoesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more\nthan paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this\nbudget is well within the spending limits already approved by the\nCongress this year.\n             \n             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators\nwho are filibustering the bill voted during the previous\nadministration for billions of dollars of the same kind of\nemergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the\nAmerican people to work.  \n             \n             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered\na plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities\nare -- on people or on politics.  \n             \n             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar\nfor dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the\nsoundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our\nchildren.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs\nand investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of\nus when we've helped make more American partners working to\nensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.\n             \n             You know, if every American who wanted a job had\none, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this\ncountry today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first\nstep to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country\nagain.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid\nfor over the life of our budget.\n             \n             Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how\nimportant the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.\n             \n             Good morning, and thank you for listening.\n\n                               END                 10:11 A.M. EDT\n\n\n\n",

I'm not going to apologize for pointing out\nthat your straw-man argument was a straw-man argument.  Nor for saying\nthat your list of \"bible contradictions\" shows such low standards of\nscholarship that it should be an embarrassment to anti-inerrantists,\njust as Josh McDowell should be an embarrassment to the fundies.  Nor\nfor objecting various times to your taking quotes out of context.  Nor\nfor pointing out that \"they do it too\" is not an excuse. Nor for calling\nyour red herrings and smoke screens what they are.\n\nI'm still not sure why you think I'm a hypocrite.  It's true that I\nhaven't responded to any of Robert Weiss' articles, which may be due in\npart to the fact that I almost never read his articles.  But I have\nresponded to both you and Frank DeCenso (a fundie/inerrantist.)  Both\nyou and Frank have taken quotes out of context, and I've objected to\nboth of you doing so.  I've criticized bad arguments both when they\nwere yours and I agreed with the conclusion (that the Bible is not\ninerrant), and when they were Frank's and I disagreed with the\nconclusion.  I've criticized both you and Frank for evading questions,\nand for trying to \"explain me away\" without addressing the objections\nI raise (you by accusing me of being hypocritical and irrational, Frank\nby accusing me of being motivated by a desire to attack the Bible.) I\ndon't see that any of this is hypocritical, nor do I apologize for it.\n\nI do apologize, however, for having offended you in any other way.\n\nHappy now?\n\ndj\n",

After a nice, long rant about how\npeople need to take personal responsibility for their economic and\nsocial lives, all of a sudden 1960's radicals (such as me, I guess)\nare responsible for poor people's lifestyles?  Tell me how that\nworks--or do you think that poor people are just too dumb to think\nfor themselves?\n\nThere are many reasons for the disintegration of the family and\nsupport systems in general among this nation's poor.  Somehow I\ndon't think Murphy Brown--or Janis Joplin--is at the top of any \nsane person's list.\n\nYou want to go after my generation's vaunted cultural revolution for\na lasting change for the worse, try so-called \"relevant\" or \"values\"\neducation.  Hey, it seemed like a good idea at the time.

He must have been abused by a man and is\n] living his life in an attempt to vilify all men who like sex with other men\n] something slightly similar to the way his assailant liked it with him. He\n] will alter or misrepresent anything he finds to try to prove that there are\n] homosexuals who wish to rape little boys like he was coming out of the\n] woodwork. There is no hope for him. In all probability he is secretly gay,\n] which compounds his neurosis in his own mind, by thinking that someone else\n] made him that way. I don't personally see how someone like him could walk\n] and chew gum at the same time, as mentally crippled and dominated as he is\n] by his fantasies.\n] \n] He would have you believe that the figures on the percentage of people who\n] like to do it with the same sex sometime or all the time is way smaller\n] than it is, but then he will virtually assert that everyone's queer and\n] they're trying to get him. He actually believes, despite all evidence that\n] homosexuals do some huge disproportionate amount of child sexual abuse,\n] even though he insists that there may be as few as 1% of them in the male\n] population! If there were that few of them in the population, San Francisco\n] would currently be empty, because a significant portion of them have sought\n] a tolerant atmosphere in that city, and the numbers simply do not work when\n] you add up their home town origins. There is nothing to be gained by\n] communicating with Clayton Cramer, he is unable to listen to anyone.\n] -RSW\n] \n] \n] --\n] * Richard STEVEn Walz   rstevew@deeptht.armory.com   (408) 429-1200  *\n] * 515 Maple Street #1   * Without safe and free abortion women are   *\n] * Santa Cruz, CA 95060    organ-surrogates to unwanted parasites.*   *\n] * Real Men would never accept organ-slavery and will protect Women.  *\n\nSorry, but I don't see how the response applies to what was posted.\n\nUnless I am badly mistaken, Rohit is suggesting that protecting boys\nfrom men is different than protecting girls from men. There are situations\nin which boys and girls are apart from members of the *opposite* sex\n(due to social convention or whatever) and thus are safe (in at least\nsome sense). These same situations don't (necessarily) protect the\nchildren from abuse by members of the *same* sex.\n\nIf we can understand that, it's not such a tremendous leap to suggest\nthat if we all think about it hard, *someone* may come up with a\npractical solution (or even a partial solution) to some of the situations\nin which children are made vulnerable to homosexuals who wish to abuse\nthem. By working together \"with good will on both sides\", we may be\nable to start solving problems without restricting anyone's freedoms.\n\nMr. Walz on the other hand is using Rohit's post as an excuse for\npersonal attacks on Mr. Cramer. While Mr. Walz hasn't (by a *long*\nstretch) been the only one to flame Mr. Cramer, it is no less childish\nand it only serves to weaken any other arguments he may make in the\nfuture.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nRick Roy       Usenet: rick@howtek.MV.com       America Online: QED\nDisclaimer: My employer's views are orthogonal to these.\nThe early bird got worms.\n",

As a \nleft-wing, big government, conventional liberal, I'm just as willing as\nyou are to vote against anti-competitive regulations that favor auto\ndealers.  \n\nBut what I hear from libertarians is a desire to limit incumbents' terms,\nto weaken government by eliminating its power to enforce antitrust laws,\nand a desire to eliminate legislator's pay.  Each strikes me as a \nparticularly ineffective way to insure that auto dealers and other special\ninterests cannot influence public policy.  In fact, they seem clearly\ndesigned to accomplish the opposite.\n\njsh\n>\n>=Mark\n--\nSteve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM   \n\"One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh\n the bulls**t.\" - R.
