        "# Project: Learning to Label – From Clustering to Classification\n",
        "In the real world, data rarely comes with clean labels. As a machine learning engineer at a data-centric company, you’re handed fairly large, unlabelled datasets across two domains—images and text. Your team is tasked with building a functional classification system, but without labeled training data, the first challenge is to create your own labels. Welcome to your mission: learning to label intelligently and building robust classifiers from scratch."

EDT\n\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that \nOctavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today \nabout why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to \nget a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature \nof learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of \npeople like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of \nthose who are here.  \n\t     \n\t     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education \nand all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my \ngood friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and \nall of the business and local community leaders from the city and \ncounty and state level from around America who are here. \n\t     \n\t     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved \nhearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is \ntheir future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A \nyear and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because \nI was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our \ncountry, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had \ntoo little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines \nof income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to \ntake us into the future.  \n\t     \n\t     I entered with the hope that together we could create \nmore opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of \nour people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of \nAmerica's community, knowing that together we could always to more \nthan we could individually and that we might secure our future.\n\t     \n\t     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 \njobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the \ncommitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, \nand those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs \ndoes, and the successes of all the young people like those on this \nstage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all \nthose things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're \non the right track.\n\t     \n\t     Last July when I was traveling across America's \nheartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in \nLouisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business \npeople who were participating in the Louisville Education and \nEmployment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  \nI saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed \nboth in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my \nown state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about \n-- that for millions of American young people it is really an \nimpediment to both their learning and their ability to be good \nworkers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what \nis learning.\n\t     \n\t     In the world in which we are living, the average young \nperson will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a \nlifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning \nworld much better.  And we must determine that all of our young \npeople see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased \nhere today.  \n\t     \n\t     Whether you're in business or in government or in \neducation, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to \nbuilding a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all \nof our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things \nare pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best \nthing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have \njobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  \n\t     \n\t     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty \ngood education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that \nthey'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either \npolitical or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great \nchallenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to \nfully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work \nfor them to do.\n\t     \n\t     All the European countries have higher unemployment \nrates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the \nunemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  \nThey're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its \nmost rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that \nI have proposed to create jobs. \n\t     \n\t     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now \nabout as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  \nIt costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of \npressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing \ntheir own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their \npeople.  \n\t     \n\t     But it is especially important for America for two \nreasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move \naggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be \ncompetitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, \neven if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed \nof the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to \nwork in this country.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some \nof it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and \nmoving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We \nhave now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big \norganizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they \nare organized and who ask whether there are too many people working \nat some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to \ncreate jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the \nchance to work.  \n\t     \n\t     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare \nreform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of \nmonths -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the \nend of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of \nthe American people to perform without regard to race or income or \nthe circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that \nthere are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their \ntalent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  \nI do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if \nyou want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more \nresponsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this \ncountry that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you \nhave got to have opportunity in that mix. \n\t     \n\t     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for \nevery young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules \nand work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be \nsomething at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are \nbasically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, \nrecognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of \nour people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their \nbackground.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's \nsomething there for them to do?\n\n\t     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an \nintegral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of \nwork and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people \nfirst, and it does have a partnership between the public and private \nsector.\n\t     \n\t     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in \nFebruary on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 \nextra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the \nAmerican business community to meet that target so that we can create  \nmore than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been \ncreated before.\n\t     \n\t     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And \nJerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in \nthis room and around the country -- people who are going to do more \nthan they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people \na work experience.  And it is terribly important.\n\t     \n\t     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is \npart of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the \nAmerican people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their \njobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving \nthe transition from school to work for young people who don't go to \ncollege but do need at least two years of post-high school training \neither on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, \nso that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more \npeople to go on to college who do want to go.\n\t     \n\t     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive \nplan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The \nemergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would \ncreate a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and \nthat would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It \nwould also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work \nforce in jobs that otherwise will not be created.\n\t     \n\t      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to \ninvest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --\nprojects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, \nnew industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities \n-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve \nthe environment.  \n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs program is an important part of that \nbecause we have tried for the first time, through the work of the \nLabor Department and the Education Department and through reaching \nout to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer \njobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to \nhopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young \npeople into further educational opportunities and to further job \nopportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component \nto these summer jobs -- something that the United States government \nhas never fully emphasized before.  \n\t     \n\t     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because \nthey come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in \ndifficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building \ntheir basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other \nareas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who \nhave difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what \nthey learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next \nyear.  \n\t     \n\t     What we are trying to do here is to give people the \nopportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning \nskills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next \ncouple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school \nin this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning \nenvironment.  \n\t     \n\t     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities \nfor people to learn and work during the school year, so that this \nwill not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will \nbe a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new \nwork experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.\n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-\nwork jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding \nthe job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help \nto build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve \nlocal problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public \nbuildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in \nhospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, \nand learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while \nthey earn, but letting them earn.\n\t     \n\t     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people \nwho have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should \ndo this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the \nopportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing \nin going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't \nexactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare \nsystem; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people \nto work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the \nuse of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if \nyou're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to \nreward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     The young people we propose to put to work under our \nprogram will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, \nreading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will \nstretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a \nsense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, \nbut a challenge that will take them into a different life.\n\t     \n\t     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even \nas I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the \nsummer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll \nsee whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer \nacademically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved \nahead.  I suspect that they will.  \n\t     \n\t     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I \nwill be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn \nfrom you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next \nsummer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school \nyear, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that \nwe do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so \nthat we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private \ninvestments as well. \n\t     \n\t     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the \nbusiness leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this \nsummer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business \nwho have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who \nhaven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about \nthis event today, I want to implore other private employers to \nstretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this \nsummer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when \nwe don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort \nthem to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up \nhere on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking \nabout work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've \ndone to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very \nfoolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand \nand sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had \never had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be \nworth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     That does not mean young people should not be \nentrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation \nahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and \nworked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  \nAnd I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some \npeople say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  \n\t     \n\t     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I \ngrew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul \nwithout regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a \njob.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to \npeople is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a \njob and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now \nI live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any \nmore money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're \nworking longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  \nAnd we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these \nyoung people want.\n\t     \n\t     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  \nIt doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration \npursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private \nsector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn \nhow to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created \nin this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done \noff-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a \nthird or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do \neconomically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of \nAmerica's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just \nkidding.  \n\t     \n\t     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy \ncountry in the world, including the United States, is having \ndifficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done \nI'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole \ndeliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the \nanswers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     And so the jobs program that I have presented to \nCongress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the \ncounties, through the Community Development Program, with the \ninfrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an \nattempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the \neconomy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little \nboost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a \nmillion jobs and maybe get the engine going again.\n\t     \n\t     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in \nthe private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government \nmoney.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American \neconomy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind \nof system we have and it works pretty well.  \n\t     \n\t     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you \nhere today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends \nand neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers \nto make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the \nfunds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government \nshould create this summer, so that together we can have this \npartnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a \nfuture -- a future that our young people can believe in.  \n\t     \n\t     We need to send them a message that here in America if \nyou study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute \nsomething to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  \nYou can build a future from you own dreams. \n\t     \n\t     That has always been the promise of America.  Together \nthat's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of \nthe promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise \nhas been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.\n\t     \n\t     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\n\n                                 END11:45 A.M. EDT\n\n\n\n",

That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,\n   but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing\n   military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than\n   just a \"we have the money, why not?\" approach.\n\nAh, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not\nwasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) bills\nto fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be\nspent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of funding\nhigh-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various\nfields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the\ndefense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to\nfund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-European\ncooperation.\n\nNow maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of\nmoney (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as\ninvestment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at\nthe size of that multiplier :->).\n\nNick Haines nickh@cmu.edu\n",

I don't\n>have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:\n>\n>[...]  Any stories on how you all learned?\n\nI'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.\n\nEarly in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on\nhis old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I\nactually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.\n\nI proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and\nrode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to\ninvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then\nI also passed my road test.\n\nOn May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a\n4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),\nI had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,\nskidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the\noncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was\nalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under\na car and been killed.\n\nNow this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the\nExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training\ncould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater\nsince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff\nas I did.\n\nSo my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I\nwouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you\nhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until\nyou're ready to use it.\n\n>1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have \n>to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too \n>ignorant to know I need to buy)\n\nWhile you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in\nDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you\nsave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,\nplus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure\nthe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up\nmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration\nand licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not\nincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.\n\n>2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in \n>about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up\n>till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a \n>motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes\n>a difference)\n\nI pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200\nin Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial\ncoverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be\npoor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo\nmore expensive.\n\n>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?\n\nThere used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle\nmagazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or\nrecent models might be available.  You could probably look through\npast issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first\nbike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice\ninstead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that\nare parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by\nnoticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around\nand they were generally set up the way I wanted.\n\nNothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting\nshowrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,\nwere very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and\nquoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence\ncheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.\n\n-- David Karr (karr@cs.cornell.edu)\n-- '80 BMW R65   DoD #0969   also BMWMOA, NRA, ACLU, et al.\n\n\n",

No cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look \nvery clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. All \nstill within factory specs.

Meaning: would gases \"so far\" down the line (the canister)\n>really have an effect on the exhaust stroke?  Do the gases really \n>compress that much?\n\n    For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses\nin the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.\n\n1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force\nair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake\nvalve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only\nthe difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after\nthe exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the\nintake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing\natmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time\ndoes the pressure ever become \"negative\", or even approach a good\nvacuum.\n\n2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the\ncombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up\nto the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume\nof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume\nthat must flow through the intake, because of the temperature\ndifference and the products of combustion.\n\n3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started\npaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty\nhorsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,\nsubstitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost\nzero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very\nwell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make\nvery little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is\n_much_ louder than the stocker.\n\n4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.\nIf free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference\nwas noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.\n\n5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any\ngiven RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it\non the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.\nPumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| Dave Tharp                      | DoD #0751   | \"You can't wear out       |\n| davet@interceptor.CDS.TEK.COM   | MRA #151    |   an Indian Scout,        |\n| '88 K75S  '48 Indian Chief      | AHRMA #751  |  Or its brother the Chief.|\n| '75 R90S(#151) '72 TR-2B(#751)  | AMA #524737 |  They're built like rocks |\n| '65 R50/2/Velorex  '57 NSU Max  |             |   to take the knocks,     |\n|       1936 BMW R12              | (Compulsive | It's the Harleys that     |\n| My employer has no idea.        |   Joiner)   |   give you grief.\"        |\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

EDT\n             \n             \n             THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  My voice is coming to\nyou this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio\nstation in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to\nmeet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,\nhealth care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly\nbroadcast with the American people. \n             \n             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when\nit reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past\nseven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with\nthe people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus\ntour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last\nyear's campaign.\n             \n             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with\nyou, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and\nwhat I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting\nto you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.\n             \n             You sent me to Washington to get our government and\neconomy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad\nexperiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important\nit is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do\nbusiness.  \n             \n             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations\nrise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness\nof their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the\ncooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,\nlabor and government.  Although many of the economies of the\nindustrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've\nmade many of the smart investments and the tough choices which\nour government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them\nhave been moving ahead and too many of our people have been\nfalling behind.\n             \n             We have an economy today that even when it grows is\nnot producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation\nby four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to\nshow for it.  We know that wages of most working people have\nstopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks\nand that too many families can no longer afford the escalating\ncost of health care.\n             \n             But we also know that, given the right tools, the\nright incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and\nbusinesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy\nneeds to expand opportunity and to make our communities better\nplaces to live.\n             \n             In many critical products today Americans are the\nlow cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that\nwe create more of those kinds of jobs.\n             \n             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for\nlong-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old\npriorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to\nbe -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs\nand education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the\nwaste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious\nresources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the\ngroundwork for robust economic growth in the future.\n             \n             These new directions passed the Congress in record\ntime and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our\ncountry.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would\ncreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private\nsector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It\nnow has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. \nBut it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the\nSenate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know\nwould result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.\n             \n             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. \nMillions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and\ncounting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill\nhas been grounded by gridlock.  \n             \n             I know the American people are tired of business as\nusual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin\nor wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have\ntaken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra\nmile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25\npercent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  \n             \n             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million\nAmericans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill\nlanguish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean\nhundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to\nact to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking\nthis initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I\nthink we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant\nportion of our original goals.\n             \n             First, we want to keep the programs as much as\npossible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,\nincluding highway and road construction, summer jobs for young\npeople, immunization for children, construction of waste water\nsites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding\nfor extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who\nhave been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't\ncreating jobs.\n             \n             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs\nin the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40\npercent.\n             \n             And third, I've recommended a new element in this\nprogram to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against\ncrime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire\npolice officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put\nthem back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight\nfor a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it\nand deserve it.\n             \n             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --\nthe Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it\nincreases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this\nyear that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,\ndoesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more\nthan paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this\nbudget is well within the spending limits already approved by the\nCongress this year.\n             \n             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators\nwho are filibustering the bill voted during the previous\nadministration for billions of dollars of the same kind of\nemergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the\nAmerican people to work.  \n             \n             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered\na plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities\nare -- on people or on politics.  \n             \n             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar\nfor dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the\nsoundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our\nchildren.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs\nand investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of\nus when we've helped make more American partners working to\nensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.\n             \n             You know, if every American who wanted a job had\none, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this\ncountry today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first\nstep to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country\nagain.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid\nfor over the life of our budget.\n             \n             Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how\nimportant the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.\n             \n             Good morning, and thank you for listening.\n\n                               END                 10:11 A.M. EDT\n\n\n\n",

He must have been abused by a man and is\n] living his life in an attempt to vilify all men who like sex with other men\n] something slightly similar to the way his assailant liked it with him. He\n] will alter or misrepresent anything he finds to try to prove that there are\n] homosexuals who wish to rape little boys like he was coming out of the\n] woodwork. There is no hope for him. In all probability he is secretly gay,\n] which compounds his neurosis in his own mind, by thinking that someone else\n] made him that way. I don't personally see how someone like him could walk\n] and chew gum at the same time, as mentally crippled and dominated as he is\n] by his fantasies.\n] \n] He would have you believe that the figures on the percentage of people who\n] like to do it with the same sex sometime or all the time is way smaller\n] than it is, but then he will virtually assert that everyone's queer and\n] they're trying to get him. He actually believes, despite all evidence that\n] homosexuals do some huge disproportionate amount of child sexual abuse,\n] even though he insists that there may be as few as 1% of them in the male\n] population! If there were that few of them in the population, San Francisco\n] would currently be empty, because a significant portion of them have sought\n] a tolerant atmosphere in that city, and the numbers simply do not work when\n] you add up their home town origins. There is nothing to be gained by\n] communicating with Clayton Cramer, he is unable to listen to anyone.\n] -RSW\n] \n] \n] --\n] * Richard STEVEn Walz   rstevew@deeptht.armory.com   (408) 429-1200  *\n] * 515 Maple Street #1   * Without safe and free abortion women are   *\n] * Santa Cruz, CA 95060    organ-surrogates to unwanted parasites.*   *\n] * Real Men would never accept organ-slavery and will protect Women.  *\n\nSorry, but I don't see how the response applies to what was posted.\n\nUnless I am badly mistaken, Rohit is suggesting that protecting boys\nfrom men is different than protecting girls from men. There are situations\nin which boys and girls are apart from members of the *opposite* sex\n(due to social convention or whatever) and thus are safe (in at least\nsome sense). These same situations don't (necessarily) protect the\nchildren from abuse by members of the *same* sex.\n\nIf we can understand that, it's not such a tremendous leap to suggest\nthat if we all think about it hard, *someone* may come up with a\npractical solution (or even a partial solution) to some of the situations\nin which children are made vulnerable to homosexuals who wish to abuse\nthem. By working together \"with good will on both sides\", we may be\nable to start solving problems without restricting anyone's freedoms.\n\nMr. Walz on the other hand is using Rohit's post as an excuse for\npersonal attacks on Mr. Cramer. While Mr. Walz hasn't (by a *long*\nstretch) been the only one to flame Mr. Cramer, it is no less childish\nand it only serves to weaken any other arguments he may make in the\nfuture.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nRick Roy       Usenet: rick@howtek.MV.com       America Online: QED\nDisclaimer: My employer's views are orthogonal to these.\nThe early bird got worms.\n",

EDT\n\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that \nOctavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today \nabout why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to \nget a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature \nof learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of \npeople like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of \nthose who are here.  \n\t     \n\t     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education \nand all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my \ngood friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and \nall of the business and local community leaders from the city and \ncounty and state level from around America who are here. \n\t     \n\t     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved \nhearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is \ntheir future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A \nyear and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because \nI was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our \ncountry, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had \ntoo little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines \nof income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to \ntake us into the future.  \n\t     \n\t     I entered with the hope that together we could create \nmore opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of \nour people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of \nAmerica's community, knowing that together we could always to more \nthan we could individually and that we might secure our future.\n\t     \n\t     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 \njobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the \ncommitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, \nand those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs \ndoes, and the successes of all the young people like those on this \nstage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all \nthose things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're \non the right track.\n\t     \n\t     Last July when I was traveling across America's \nheartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in \nLouisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business \npeople who were participating in the Louisville Education and \nEmployment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  \nI saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed \nboth in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my \nown state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about \n-- that for millions of American young people it is really an \nimpediment to both their learning and their ability to be good \nworkers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what \nis learning.\n\t     \n\t     In the world in which we are living, the average young \nperson will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a \nlifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning \nworld much better.  And we must determine that all of our young \npeople see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased \nhere today.  \n\t     \n\t     Whether you're in business or in government or in \neducation, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to \nbuilding a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all \nof our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things \nare pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best \nthing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have \njobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  \n\t     \n\t     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty \ngood education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that \nthey'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either \npolitical or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great \nchallenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to \nfully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work \nfor them to do.\n\t     \n\t     All the European countries have higher unemployment \nrates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the \nunemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  \nThey're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its \nmost rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that \nI have proposed to create jobs. \n\t     \n\t     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now \nabout as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  \nIt costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of \npressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing \ntheir own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their \npeople.  \n\t     \n\t     But it is especially important for America for two \nreasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move \naggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be \ncompetitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, \neven if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed \nof the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to \nwork in this country.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some \nof it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and \nmoving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We \nhave now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big \norganizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they \nare organized and who ask whether there are too many people working \nat some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to \ncreate jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the \nchance to work.  \n\t     \n\t     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare \nreform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of \nmonths -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the \nend of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of \nthe American people to perform without regard to race or income or \nthe circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that \nthere are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their \ntalent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  \nI do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if \nyou want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more \nresponsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this \ncountry that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you \nhave got to have opportunity in that mix. \n\t     \n\t     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for \nevery young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules \nand work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be \nsomething at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are \nbasically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, \nrecognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of \nour people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their \nbackground.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's \nsomething there for them to do?\n\n\t     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an \nintegral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of \nwork and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people \nfirst, and it does have a partnership between the public and private \nsector.\n\t     \n\t     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in \nFebruary on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 \nextra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the \nAmerican business community to meet that target so that we can create  \nmore than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been \ncreated before.\n\t     \n\t     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And \nJerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in \nthis room and around the country -- people who are going to do more \nthan they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people \na work experience.  And it is terribly important.\n\t     \n\t     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is \npart of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the \nAmerican people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their \njobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving \nthe transition from school to work for young people who don't go to \ncollege but do need at least two years of post-high school training \neither on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, \nso that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more \npeople to go on to college who do want to go.\n\t     \n\t     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive \nplan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The \nemergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would \ncreate a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and \nthat would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It \nwould also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work \nforce in jobs that otherwise will not be created.\n\t     \n\t      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to \ninvest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --\nprojects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, \nnew industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities \n-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve \nthe environment.  \n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs program is an important part of that \nbecause we have tried for the first time, through the work of the \nLabor Department and the Education Department and through reaching \nout to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer \njobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to \nhopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young \npeople into further educational opportunities and to further job \nopportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component \nto these summer jobs -- something that the United States government \nhas never fully emphasized before.  \n\t     \n\t     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because \nthey come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in \ndifficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building \ntheir basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other \nareas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who \nhave difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what \nthey learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next \nyear.  \n\t     \n\t     What we are trying to do here is to give people the \nopportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning \nskills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next \ncouple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school \nin this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning \nenvironment.  \n\t     \n\t     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities \nfor people to learn and work during the school year, so that this \nwill not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will \nbe a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new \nwork experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.\n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-\nwork jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding \nthe job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help \nto build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve \nlocal problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public \nbuildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in \nhospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, \nand learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while \nthey earn, but letting them earn.\n\t     \n\t     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people \nwho have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should \ndo this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the \nopportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing \nin going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't \nexactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare \nsystem; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people \nto work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the \nuse of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if \nyou're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to \nreward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     The young people we propose to put to work under our \nprogram will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, \nreading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will \nstretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a \nsense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, \nbut a challenge that will take them into a different life.\n\t     \n\t     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even \nas I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the \nsummer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll \nsee whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer \nacademically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved \nahead.  I suspect that they will.  \n\t     \n\t     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I \nwill be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn \nfrom you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next \nsummer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school \nyear, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that \nwe do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so \nthat we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private \ninvestments as well. \n\t     \n\t     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the \nbusiness leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this \nsummer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business \nwho have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who \nhaven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about \nthis event today, I want to implore other private employers to \nstretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this \nsummer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when \nwe don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort \nthem to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up \nhere on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking \nabout work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've \ndone to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very \nfoolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand \nand sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had \never had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be \nworth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     That does not mean young people should not be \nentrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation \nahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and \nworked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  \nAnd I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some \npeople say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  \n\t     \n\t     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I \ngrew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul \nwithout regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a \njob.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to \npeople is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a \njob and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now \nI live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any \nmore money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're \nworking longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  \nAnd we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these \nyoung people want.\n\t     \n\t     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  \nIt doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration \npursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private \nsector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn \nhow to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created \nin this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done \noff-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a \nthird or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do \neconomically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of \nAmerica's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just \nkidding.  \n\t     \n\t     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy \ncountry in the world, including the United States, is having \ndifficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done \nI'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole \ndeliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the \nanswers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     And so the jobs program that I have presented to \nCongress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the \ncounties, through the Community Development Program, with the \ninfrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an \nattempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the \neconomy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little \nboost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a \nmillion jobs and maybe get the engine going again.\n\t     \n\t     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in \nthe private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government \nmoney.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American \neconomy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind \nof system we have and it works pretty well.  \n\t     \n\t     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you \nhere today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends \nand neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers \nto make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the \nfunds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government \nshould create this summer, so that together we can have this \npartnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a \nfuture -- a future that our young people can believe in.  \n\t     \n\t     We need to send them a message that here in America if \nyou study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute \nsomething to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  \nYou can build a future from you own dreams. \n\t     \n\t     That has always been the promise of America.  Together \nthat's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of \nthe promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise \nhas been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.\n\t     \n\t     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\n\n                                 END11:45 A.M. EDT\n\n\n\n",

That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,\n   but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing\n   military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than\n   just a \"we have the money, why not?\" approach.\n\nAh, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not\nwasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) bills\nto fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be\nspent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of funding\nhigh-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various\nfields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the\ndefense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to\nfund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-European\ncooperation.\n\nNow maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of\nmoney (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as\ninvestment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at\nthe size of that multiplier :->).\n\nNick Haines nickh@cmu.edu\n",

I don't\n>have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:\n>\n>[...]  Any stories on how you all learned?\n\nI'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.\n\nEarly in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on\nhis old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I\nactually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.\n\nI proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and\nrode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to\ninvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then\nI also passed my road test.\n\nOn May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a\n4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),\nI had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,\nskidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the\noncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was\nalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under\na car and been killed.\n\nNow this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the\nExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training\ncould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater\nsince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff\nas I did.\n\nSo my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I\nwouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you\nhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until\nyou're ready to use it.\n\n>1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have \n>to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too \n>ignorant to know I need to buy)\n\nWhile you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in\nDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you\nsave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,\nplus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure\nthe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up\nmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration\nand licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not\nincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.\n\n>2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in \n>about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up\n>till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a \n>motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes\n>a difference)\n\nI pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200\nin Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial\ncoverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be\npoor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo\nmore expensive.\n\n>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?\n\nThere used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle\nmagazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or\nrecent models might be available.  You could probably look through\npast issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first\nbike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice\ninstead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that\nare parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by\nnoticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around\nand they were generally set up the way I wanted.\n\nNothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting\nshowrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,\nwere very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and\nquoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence\ncheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.\n\n-- David Karr (karr@cs.cornell.edu)\n-- '80 BMW R65   DoD #0969   also BMWMOA, NRA, ACLU, et al.\n\n\n",

Speaking from personal\nexperience, I have had judges illegally assume jurisdiction even after\nI demanded that the DA prove such jurisdiction on the record, and the\nDA stood mute.  I have also had an appellate court uphold such action\nand hide behind California Rules of Court, Rule 106 (\"The judges of\nthe appellate department shall not be required to write opinions in\nany cases decided by them, but may do so whenever they deem it\nadvisable or in the public interest.\").

                  "Organization: University of Waterloo\n\nHi, I just have a small question about my bike. \nBeing a fairly experienced BMW and MZ-Mechanic, I just don't know what to \nthink about my Honda. \nShe was using too much oil for the last 5000 km (on my trip to Daytona bike \nweek this spring), and all of a sudden, she trailed smoke like hell and \nwas running only on one cylinder. \nI towed the bike home and took it apart, but everything looks in perfect \nworking order. No cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look \nvery clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. All \nstill within factory specs. The only thing I could find, however, was a \nslightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder (the one with the problem), \nbut it is still way below the wear-limit given in the Clymer-manual for \nthis bike. \nAny syggestions??? What else could cause my problem??? Do I have to hone \nthe cylinder walls (make them a little rougher in a criss-cross-pattern) in \norder to get better breaking in of my new rings??? Won't that increase the \nwear of my pistons??\nPlease send comments to \n\tsruhl@mechanical.watstar.uwaterloo.ca\nThanks in advance. Stef. \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \nStefan Ruhl \ngerman exchange student. \nDon't poke into my privacy ! \n",

I was doing research on subliminal suggestion for a psychology\npaper, and I read that one researcher flashed hidden messages on the\nTV screen at 1/200ths of a second.  Is that possible?

Around the base of the hourglass is a\nring of water towers.  Warm river water, coming from the steam condenser\nin the plant, is sprayed over louvres.  The draft being pulled through\nthe tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection.  The\nsensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for\ndraft generation.\n\nIt should be noted that the hourglass-shaped cooling towers are used on\nboth fossile and nuclear plants.  It should also be noted that at \nlocations where water is plentiful, the cooling towers are only used part\ntime, when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit.\nIt was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish.\nFishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect.  Nontheless, stringent,\nusually state, regulations remain in some instances.  Since it typically\ntakes 60,000 hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed \nto cool a 1000 MWe plant, the cost of using the towers is not insignificant.\n-- \nJohn De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?  \nPerformance Engineering Magazine(TM) | Interested in high tech and computers? \nMarietta, Ga                         | Send ur snail-mail address to \njgd@dixie.com                        | perform@dixie.com for a free sample mag\nLee Harvey Oswald: Where are ya when we need ya?\n",

Do the gases really \n>compress that much?\n\n    For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses\nin the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.\n\n1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force\nair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake\nvalve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only\nthe difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after\nthe exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the\nintake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing\natmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time\ndoes the pressure ever become \"negative\", or even approach a good\nvacuum.\n\n2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the\ncombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up\nto the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume\nof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume\nthat must flow through the intake, because of the temperature\ndifference and the products of combustion.\n\n3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started\npaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty\nhorsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,\nsubstitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost\nzero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very\nwell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make\nvery little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is\n_much_ louder than the stocker.\n\n4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.\nIf free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference\nwas noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.\n\n5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any\ngiven RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it\non the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.\nPumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| Dave Tharp                      | DoD #0751   | \"You can't wear out       |\n| davet@interceptor.CDS.TEK.COM   | MRA #151    |   an Indian Scout,        |\n| '88 K75S  '48 Indian Chief      | AHRMA #751  |  Or its brother the Chief.|\n| '75 R90S(#151) '72 TR-2B(#751)  | AMA #524737 |  They're built like rocks |\n| '65 R50/2/Velorex  '57 NSU Max  |             |   to take the knocks,     |\n|       1936 BMW R12              | (Compulsive | It's the Harleys that     |\n| My employer has no idea.        |   Joiner)   |   give you grief.\"        |\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

What you say is true, but\nthe law, in order to make what little sense it manages to make, has to\nmake *some* assumptions.  Assuming that an illegal activity is unwanted\nby the average citizen I think is reasonable.  Certainly, I would need\na preponderance of evidence on the side of the propositioner that there\nwas a reasonable belief that the proposition was welcome.\n\nThe number of people who participate in \"victimless\" crimes notwithstanding,\nthe fact reamins that under the law, the activity is illegal.

Ideally, something that is geared toward \nhobbyists:  small quantity, mail order, etc.\n\nFor years, we've been buying them from a distributor (Marshall) by the\nhundreds for PMP kits.  But orders have dropped to the point where we can\nno longer afford to offer this service.  And all of the distributors I've\nchecked have some crazy minimum order ($100, or so).\n\nI'd like to find a source for those still interested in building PMP kits.\nAny suggestions?\n\n-- \nAndrew C.

EDT\n             \n             \n             THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  My voice is coming to\nyou this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio\nstation in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to\nmeet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,\nhealth care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly\nbroadcast with the American people. \n             \n             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when\nit reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past\nseven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with\nthe people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus\ntour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last\nyear's campaign.\n             \n             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with\nyou, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and\nwhat I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting\nto you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.\n             \n             You sent me to Washington to get our government and\neconomy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad\nexperiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important\nit is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do\nbusiness.  \n             \n             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations\nrise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness\nof their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the\ncooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,\nlabor and government.  Although many of the economies of the\nindustrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've\nmade many of the smart investments and the tough choices which\nour government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them\nhave been moving ahead and too many of our people have been\nfalling behind.\n             \n             We have an economy today that even when it grows is\nnot producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation\nby four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to\nshow for it.  We know that wages of most working people have\nstopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks\nand that too many families can no longer afford the escalating\ncost of health care.\n             \n             But we also know that, given the right tools, the\nright incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and\nbusinesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy\nneeds to expand opportunity and to make our communities better\nplaces to live.\n             \n             In many critical products today Americans are the\nlow cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that\nwe create more of those kinds of jobs.\n             \n             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for\nlong-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old\npriorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to\nbe -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs\nand education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the\nwaste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious\nresources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the\ngroundwork for robust economic growth in the future.\n             \n             These new directions passed the Congress in record\ntime and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our\ncountry.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would\ncreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private\nsector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It\nnow has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. \nBut it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the\nSenate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know\nwould result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.\n             \n             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. \nMillions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and\ncounting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill\nhas been grounded by gridlock.  \n             \n             I know the American people are tired of business as\nusual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin\nor wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have\ntaken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra\nmile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25\npercent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  \n             \n             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million\nAmericans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill\nlanguish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean\nhundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to\nact to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking\nthis initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I\nthink we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant\nportion of our original goals.\n             \n             First, we want to keep the programs as much as\npossible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,\nincluding highway and road construction, summer jobs for young\npeople, immunization for children, construction of waste water\nsites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding\nfor extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who\nhave been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't\ncreating jobs.\n             \n             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs\nin the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40\npercent.\n             \n             And third, I've recommended a new element in this\nprogram to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against\ncrime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire\npolice officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put\nthem back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight\nfor a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it\nand deserve it.\n             \n             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --\nthe Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it\nincreases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this\nyear that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,\ndoesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more\nthan paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this\nbudget is well within the spending limits already approved by the\nCongress this year.\n             \n             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators\nwho are filibustering the bill voted during the previous\nadministration for billions of dollars of the same kind of\nemergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the\nAmerican people to work.  \n             \n             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered\na plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities\nare -- on people or on politics.  \n             \n             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar\nfor dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the\nsoundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our\nchildren.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs\nand investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of\nus when we've helped make more American partners working to\nensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.\n             \n             You know, if every American who wanted a job had\none, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this\ncountry today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first\nstep to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country\nagain.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid\nfor over the life of our budget.\n             \n             Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how\nimportant the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.\n             \n             Good morning, and thank you for listening.\n\n                               END                 10:11 A.M. EDT\n\n\n\n",

I'm not going to apologize for pointing out\nthat your straw-man argument was a straw-man argument.  Nor for saying\nthat your list of \"bible contradictions\" shows such low standards of\nscholarship that it should be an embarrassment to anti-inerrantists,\njust as Josh McDowell should be an embarrassment to the fundies.  Nor\nfor objecting various times to your taking quotes out of context.  Nor\nfor pointing out that \"they do it too\" is not an excuse. Nor for calling\nyour red herrings and smoke screens what they are.\n\nI'm still not sure why you think I'm a hypocrite.  It's true that I\nhaven't responded to any of Robert Weiss' articles, which may be due in\npart to the fact that I almost never read his articles.  But I have\nresponded to both you and Frank DeCenso (a fundie/inerrantist.)  Both\nyou and Frank have taken quotes out of context, and I've objected to\nboth of you doing so.  I've criticized bad arguments both when they\nwere yours and I agreed with the conclusion (that the Bible is not\ninerrant), and when they were Frank's and I disagreed with the\nconclusion.  I've criticized both you and Frank for evading questions,\nand for trying to \"explain me away\" without addressing the objections\nI raise (you by accusing me of being hypocritical and irrational, Frank\nby accusing me of being motivated by a desire to attack the Bible.) I\ndon't see that any of this is hypocritical, nor do I apologize for it.\n\nI do apologize, however, for having offended you in any other way.\n\nHappy now?\n\ndj\n",

They must account for this...\n\nNow let me get this straight.  After a nice, long rant about how\npeople need to take personal responsibility for their economic and\nsocial lives, all of a sudden 1960's radicals (such as me, I guess)\nare responsible for poor people's lifestyles?  Tell me how that\nworks--or do you think that poor people are just too dumb to think\nfor themselves?\n\nThere are many reasons for the disintegration of the family and\nsupport systems in general among this nation's poor.  Somehow I\ndon't think Murphy Brown--or Janis Joplin--is at the top of any \nsane person's list.\n\nYou want to go after my generation's vaunted cultural revolution for\na lasting change for the worse, try so-called \"relevant\" or \"values\"\neducation.  Hey, it seemed like a good idea at the time.  How were\nwe to know you needed a real education first--I mean, we took that\nfor granted.\n\n               *** ***\nKen Perlow   ***** *****\n05 Apr 93   ****** ******   16 Germinal An CCI\n            *****   *****   gadfly@ihspc.att.com\n             ** ** ** **\n...L'AUDACE!   *** ***   TOUJOURS DE L'AUDACE!

He must have been abused by a man and is\n] living his life in an attempt to vilify all men who like sex with other men\n] something slightly similar to the way his assailant liked it with him. He\n] will alter or misrepresent anything he finds to try to prove that there are\n] homosexuals who wish to rape little boys like he was coming out of the\n] woodwork. There is no hope for him. In all probability he is secretly gay,\n] which compounds his neurosis in his own mind, by thinking that someone else\n] made him that way. I don't personally see how someone like him could walk\n] and chew gum at the same time, as mentally crippled and dominated as he is\n] by his fantasies.\n] \n] He would have you believe that the figures on the percentage of people who\n] like to do it with the same sex sometime or all the time is way smaller\n] than it is, but then he will virtually assert that everyone's queer and\n] they're trying to get him. He actually believes, despite all evidence that\n] homosexuals do some huge disproportionate amount of child sexual abuse,\n] even though he insists that there may be as few as 1% of them in the male\n] population! If there were that few of them in the population, San Francisco\n] would currently be empty, because a significant portion of them have sought\n] a tolerant atmosphere in that city, and the numbers simply do not work when\n] you add up their home town origins. There is nothing to be gained by\n] communicating with Clayton Cramer, he is unable to listen to anyone.\n] -RSW\n] \n] \n] --\n] * Richard STEVEn Walz   rstevew@deeptht.armory.com   (408) 429-1200  *\n] * 515 Maple Street #1   * Without safe and free abortion women are   *\n] * Santa Cruz, CA 95060    organ-surrogates to unwanted parasites.*   *\n] * Real Men would never accept organ-slavery and will protect Women.  *\n\nSorry, but I don't see how the response applies to what was posted.\n\nUnless I am badly mistaken, Rohit is suggesting that protecting boys\nfrom men is different than protecting girls from men. There are situations\nin which boys and girls are apart from members of the *opposite* sex\n(due to social convention or whatever) and thus are safe (in at least\nsome sense). These same situations don't (necessarily) protect the\nchildren from abuse by members of the *same* sex.\n\nIf we can understand that, it's not such a tremendous leap to suggest\nthat if we all think about it hard, *someone* may come up with a\npractical solution (or even a partial solution) to some of the situations\nin which children are made vulnerable to homosexuals who wish to abuse\nthem. By working together \"with good will on both sides\", we may be\nable to start solving problems without restricting anyone's freedoms.\n\nMr. Walz on the other hand is using Rohit's post as an excuse for\npersonal attacks on Mr. Cramer. While Mr. Walz hasn't (by a *long*\nstretch) been the only one to flame Mr. Cramer, it is no less childish\nand it only serves to weaken any other arguments he may make in the\nfuture.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nRick Roy       Usenet: rick@howtek.MV.com       America Online: QED\nDisclaimer: My employer's views are orthogonal to these.\nThe early bird got worms.\n",

As a \nleft-wing, big government, conventional liberal, I'm just as willing as\nyou are to vote against anti-competitive regulations that favor auto\ndealers.  \n\nBut what I hear from libertarians is a desire to limit incumbents' terms,\nto weaken government by eliminating its power to enforce antitrust laws,\nand a desire to eliminate legislator's pay.  Each strikes me as a \nparticularly ineffective way to insure that auto dealers and other special\ninterests cannot influence public policy.  In fact, they seem clearly\ndesigned to accomplish the opposite.\n\njsh\n>\n>=Mark\n--\nSteve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM   \n\"One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh\n the bulls**t.\" - R.

EDT\n\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that \nOctavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today \nabout why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to \nget a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature \nof learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of \npeople like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of \nthose who are here.  \n\t     \n\t     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education \nand all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my \ngood friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and \nall of the business and local community leaders from the city and \ncounty and state level from around America who are here. \n\t     \n\t     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved \nhearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is \ntheir future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A \nyear and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because \nI was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our \ncountry, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had \ntoo little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines \nof income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to \ntake us into the future.  \n\t     \n\t     I entered with the hope that together we could create \nmore opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of \nour people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of \nAmerica's community, knowing that together we could always to more \nthan we could individually and that we might secure our future.\n\t     \n\t     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 \njobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the \ncommitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, \nand those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs \ndoes, and the successes of all the young people like those on this \nstage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all \nthose things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're \non the right track.\n\t     \n\t     Last July when I was traveling across America's \nheartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in \nLouisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business \npeople who were participating in the Louisville Education and \nEmployment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  \nI saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed \nboth in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my \nown state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about \n-- that for millions of American young people it is really an \nimpediment to both their learning and their ability to be good \nworkers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what \nis learning.\n\t     \n\t     In the world in which we are living, the average young \nperson will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a \nlifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning \nworld much better.  And we must determine that all of our young \npeople see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased \nhere today.  \n\t     \n\t     Whether you're in business or in government or in \neducation, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to \nbuilding a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all \nof our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things \nare pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best \nthing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have \njobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  \n\t     \n\t     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty \ngood education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that \nthey'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either \npolitical or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great \nchallenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to \nfully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work \nfor them to do.\n\t     \n\t     All the European countries have higher unemployment \nrates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the \nunemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  \nThey're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its \nmost rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that \nI have proposed to create jobs. \n\t     \n\t     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now \nabout as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  \nIt costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of \npressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing \ntheir own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their \npeople.  \n\t     \n\t     But it is especially important for America for two \nreasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move \naggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be \ncompetitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, \neven if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed \nof the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to \nwork in this country.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some \nof it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and \nmoving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We \nhave now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big \norganizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they \nare organized and who ask whether there are too many people working \nat some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to \ncreate jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the \nchance to work.  \n\t     \n\t     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare \nreform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of \nmonths -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the \nend of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of \nthe American people to perform without regard to race or income or \nthe circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that \nthere are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their \ntalent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  \nI do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if \nyou want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more \nresponsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this \ncountry that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you \nhave got to have opportunity in that mix. \n\t     \n\t     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for \nevery young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules \nand work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be \nsomething at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are \nbasically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, \nrecognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of \nour people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their \nbackground.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's \nsomething there for them to do?\n\n\t     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an \nintegral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of \nwork and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people \nfirst, and it does have a partnership between the public and private \nsector.\n\t     \n\t     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in \nFebruary on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 \nextra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the \nAmerican business community to meet that target so that we can create  \nmore than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been \ncreated before.\n\t     \n\t     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And \nJerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in \nthis room and around the country -- people who are going to do more \nthan they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people \na work experience.  And it is terribly important.\n\t     \n\t     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is \npart of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the \nAmerican people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their \njobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving \nthe transition from school to work for young people who don't go to \ncollege but do need at least two years of post-high school training \neither on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, \nso that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more \npeople to go on to college who do want to go.\n\t     \n\t     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive \nplan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The \nemergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would \ncreate a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and \nthat would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It \nwould also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work \nforce in jobs that otherwise will not be created.\n\t     \n\t      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to \ninvest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --\nprojects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, \nnew industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities \n-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve \nthe environment.  \n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs program is an important part of that \nbecause we have tried for the first time, through the work of the \nLabor Department and the Education Department and through reaching \nout to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer \njobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to \nhopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young \npeople into further educational opportunities and to further job \nopportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component \nto these summer jobs -- something that the United States government \nhas never fully emphasized before.  \n\t     \n\t     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because \nthey come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in \ndifficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building \ntheir basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other \nareas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who \nhave difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what \nthey learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next \nyear.  \n\t     \n\t     What we are trying to do here is to give people the \nopportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning \nskills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next \ncouple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school \nin this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning \nenvironment.  \n\t     \n\t     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities \nfor people to learn and work during the school year, so that this \nwill not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will \nbe a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new \nwork experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.\n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-\nwork jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding \nthe job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help \nto build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve \nlocal problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public \nbuildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in \nhospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, \nand learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while \nthey earn, but letting them earn.\n\t     \n\t     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people \nwho have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should \ndo this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the \nopportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing \nin going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't \nexactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare \nsystem; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people \nto work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the \nuse of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if \nyou're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to \nreward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     The young people we propose to put to work under our \nprogram will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, \nreading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will \nstretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a \nsense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, \nbut a challenge that will take them into a different life.\n\t     \n\t     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even \nas I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the \nsummer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll \nsee whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer \nacademically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved \nahead.  I suspect that they will.  \n\t     \n\t     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I \nwill be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn \nfrom you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next \nsummer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school \nyear, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that \nwe do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so \nthat we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private \ninvestments as well. \n\t     \n\t     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the \nbusiness leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this \nsummer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business \nwho have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who \nhaven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about \nthis event today, I want to implore other private employers to \nstretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this \nsummer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when \nwe don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort \nthem to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up \nhere on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking \nabout work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've \ndone to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very \nfoolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand \nand sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had \never had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be \nworth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     That does not mean young people should not be \nentrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation \nahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and \nworked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  \nAnd I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some \npeople say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  \n\t     \n\t     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I \ngrew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul \nwithout regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a \njob.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to \npeople is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a \njob and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now \nI live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any \nmore money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're \nworking longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  \nAnd we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these \nyoung people want.\n\t     \n\t     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  \nIt doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration \npursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private \nsector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn \nhow to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created \nin this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done \noff-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a \nthird or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do \neconomically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of \nAmerica's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just \nkidding.  \n\t     \n\t     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy \ncountry in the world, including the United States, is having \ndifficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done \nI'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole \ndeliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the \nanswers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     And so the jobs program that I have presented to \nCongress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the \ncounties, through the Community Development Program, with the \ninfrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an \nattempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the \neconomy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little \nboost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a \nmillion jobs and maybe get the engine going again.\n\t     \n\t     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in \nthe private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government \nmoney.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American \neconomy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind \nof system we have and it works pretty well.  \n\t     \n\t     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you \nhere today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends \nand neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers \nto make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the \nfunds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government \nshould create this summer, so that together we can have this \npartnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a \nfuture -- a future that our young people can believe in.  \n\t     \n\t     We need to send them a message that here in America if \nyou study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute \nsomething to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  \nYou can build a future from you own dreams. \n\t     \n\t     That has always been the promise of America.  Together \nthat's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of \nthe promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise \nhas been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.\n\t     \n\t     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\n\n                                 END11:45 A.M. EDT\n\n\n\n",

That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,\n   but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing\n   military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than\n   just a \"we have the money, why not?\" approach.\n\nAh, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not\nwasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) bills\nto fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be\nspent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of funding\nhigh-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various\nfields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the\ndefense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to\nfund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-European\ncooperation.\n\nNow maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of\nmoney (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as\ninvestment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at\nthe size of that multiplier :->).\n\nNick Haines nickh@cmu.edu\n",

I don't\n>have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:\n>\n>[...]  Any stories on how you all learned?\n\nI'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.\n\nEarly in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on\nhis old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I\nactually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.\n\nI proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and\nrode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to\ninvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then\nI also passed my road test.\n\nOn May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a\n4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),\nI had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,\nskidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the\noncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was\nalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under\na car and been killed.\n\nNow this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the\nExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training\ncould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater\nsince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff\nas I did.\n\nSo my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I\nwouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you\nhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until\nyou're ready to use it.\n\n>1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have \n>to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too \n>ignorant to know I need to buy)\n\nWhile you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in\nDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you\nsave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,\nplus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure\nthe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up\nmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration\nand licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not\nincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.\n\n>2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in \n>about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up\n>till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a \n>motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes\n>a difference)\n\nI pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200\nin Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial\ncoverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be\npoor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo\nmore expensive.\n\n>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?\n\nThere used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle\nmagazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or\nrecent models might be available.  You could probably look through\npast issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first\nbike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice\ninstead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that\nare parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by\nnoticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around\nand they were generally set up the way I wanted.\n\nNothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting\nshowrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,\nwere very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and\nquoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence\ncheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.\n\n-- David Karr (karr@cs.cornell.edu)\n-- '80 BMW R65   DoD #0969   also BMWMOA, NRA, ACLU, et al.\n\n\n",

Speaking from personal\nexperience, I have had judges illegally assume jurisdiction even after\nI demanded that the DA prove such jurisdiction on the record, and the\nDA stood mute.  I have also had an appellate court uphold such action\nand hide behind California Rules of Court, Rule 106 (\"The judges of\nthe appellate department shall not be required to write opinions in\nany cases decided by them, but may do so whenever they deem it\nadvisable or in the public interest.\").

                  "Organization: University of Waterloo\n\nHi, I just have a small question about my bike. \nBeing a fairly experienced BMW and MZ-Mechanic, I just don't know what to \nthink about my Honda. \nShe was using too much oil for the last 5000 km (on my trip to Daytona bike \nweek this spring), and all of a sudden, she trailed smoke like hell and \nwas running only on one cylinder. \nI towed the bike home and took it apart, but everything looks in perfect \nworking order. No cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look \nvery clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. All \nstill within factory specs. The only thing I could find, however, was a \nslightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder (the one with the problem), \nbut it is still way below the wear-limit given in the Clymer-manual for \nthis bike. \nAny syggestions??? What else could cause my problem??? Do I have to hone \nthe cylinder walls (make them a little rougher in a criss-cross-pattern) in \norder to get better breaking in of my new rings??? Won't that increase the \nwear of my pistons??\nPlease send comments to \n\tsruhl@mechanical.watstar.uwaterloo.ca\nThanks in advance. Stef. \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \nStefan Ruhl \ngerman exchange student. \nDon't poke into my privacy ! \n",

I was doing research on subliminal suggestion for a psychology\npaper, and I read that one researcher flashed hidden messages on the\nTV screen at 1/200ths of a second.  Is that possible?

Around the base of the hourglass is a\nring of water towers.  Warm river water, coming from the steam condenser\nin the plant, is sprayed over louvres.  The draft being pulled through\nthe tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection.  The\nsensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for\ndraft generation.\n\nIt should be noted that the hourglass-shaped cooling towers are used on\nboth fossile and nuclear plants.  It should also be noted that at \nlocations where water is plentiful, the cooling towers are only used part\ntime, when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit.\nIt was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish.\nFishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect.  Nontheless, stringent,\nusually state, regulations remain in some instances.  Since it typically\ntakes 60,000 hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed \nto cool a 1000 MWe plant, the cost of using the towers is not insignificant.\n-- \nJohn De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?  \nPerformance Engineering Magazine(TM) | Interested in high tech and computers? \nMarietta, Ga                         | Send ur snail-mail address to \njgd@dixie.com                        | perform@dixie.com for a free sample mag\nLee Harvey Oswald: Where are ya when we need ya?\n",

Do the gases really \n>compress that much?\n\n    For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses\nin the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.\n\n1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force\nair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake\nvalve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only\nthe difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after\nthe exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the\nintake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing\natmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time\ndoes the pressure ever become \"negative\", or even approach a good\nvacuum.\n\n2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the\ncombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up\nto the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume\nof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume\nthat must flow through the intake, because of the temperature\ndifference and the products of combustion.\n\n3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started\npaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty\nhorsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,\nsubstitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost\nzero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very\nwell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make\nvery little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is\n_much_ louder than the stocker.\n\n4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.\nIf free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference\nwas noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.\n\n5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any\ngiven RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it\non the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.\nPumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| Dave Tharp                      | DoD #0751   | \"You can't wear out       |\n| davet@interceptor.CDS.TEK.COM   | MRA #151    |   an Indian Scout,        |\n| '88 K75S  '48 Indian Chief      | AHRMA #751  |  Or its brother the Chief.|\n| '75 R90S(#151) '72 TR-2B(#751)  | AMA #524737 |  They're built like rocks |\n| '65 R50/2/Velorex  '57 NSU Max  |             |   to take the knocks,     |\n|       1936 BMW R12              | (Compulsive | It's the Harleys that     |\n| My employer has no idea.        |   Joiner)   |   give you grief.\"        |\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

What you say is true, but\nthe law, in order to make what little sense it manages to make, has to\nmake *some* assumptions.  Assuming that an illegal activity is unwanted\nby the average citizen I think is reasonable.  Certainly, I would need\na preponderance of evidence on the side of the propositioner that there\nwas a reasonable belief that the proposition was welcome.\n\nThe number of people who participate in \"victimless\" crimes notwithstanding,\nthe fact reamins that under the law, the activity is illegal.

Ideally, something that is geared toward \nhobbyists:  small quantity, mail order, etc.\n\nFor years, we've been buying them from a distributor (Marshall) by the\nhundreds for PMP kits.  But orders have dropped to the point where we can\nno longer afford to offer this service.  And all of the distributors I've\nchecked have some crazy minimum order ($100, or so).\n\nI'd like to find a source for those still interested in building PMP kits.\nAny suggestions?\n\n-- \nAndrew C.

EDT\n             \n             \n             THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  My voice is coming to\nyou this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio\nstation in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to\nmeet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,\nhealth care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly\nbroadcast with the American people. \n             \n             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when\nit reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past\nseven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with\nthe people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus\ntour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last\nyear's campaign.\n             \n             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with\nyou, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and\nwhat I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting\nto you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.\n             \n             You sent me to Washington to get our government and\neconomy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad\nexperiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important\nit is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do\nbusiness.  \n             \n             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations\nrise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness\nof their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the\ncooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,\nlabor and government.  Although many of the economies of the\nindustrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've\nmade many of the smart investments and the tough choices which\nour government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them\nhave been moving ahead and too many of our people have been\nfalling behind.\n             \n             We have an economy today that even when it grows is\nnot producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation\nby four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to\nshow for it.  We know that wages of most working people have\nstopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks\nand that too many families can no longer afford the escalating\ncost of health care.\n             \n             But we also know that, given the right tools, the\nright incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and\nbusinesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy\nneeds to expand opportunity and to make our communities better\nplaces to live.\n             \n             In many critical products today Americans are the\nlow cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that\nwe create more of those kinds of jobs.\n             \n             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for\nlong-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old\npriorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to\nbe -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs\nand education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the\nwaste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious\nresources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the\ngroundwork for robust economic growth in the future.\n             \n             These new directions passed the Congress in record\ntime and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our\ncountry.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would\ncreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private\nsector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It\nnow has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. \nBut it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the\nSenate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know\nwould result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.\n             \n             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. \nMillions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and\ncounting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill\nhas been grounded by gridlock.  \n             \n             I know the American people are tired of business as\nusual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin\nor wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have\ntaken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra\nmile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25\npercent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  \n             \n             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million\nAmericans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill\nlanguish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean\nhundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to\nact to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking\nthis initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I\nthink we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant\nportion of our original goals.\n             \n             First, we want to keep the programs as much as\npossible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,\nincluding highway and road construction, summer jobs for young\npeople, immunization for children, construction of waste water\nsites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding\nfor extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who\nhave been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't\ncreating jobs.\n             \n             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs\nin the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40\npercent.\n             \n             And third, I've recommended a new element in this\nprogram to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against\ncrime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire\npolice officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put\nthem back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight\nfor a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it\nand deserve it.\n             \n             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --\nthe Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it\nincreases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this\nyear that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,\ndoesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more\nthan paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this\nbudget is well within the spending limits already approved by the\nCongress this year.\n             \n             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators\nwho are filibustering the bill voted during the previous\nadministration for billions of dollars of the same kind of\nemergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the\nAmerican people to work.  \n             \n             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered\na plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities\nare -- on people or on politics.  \n             \n             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar\nfor dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the\nsoundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our\nchildren.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs\nand investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of\nus when we've helped make more American partners working to\nensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.\n             \n             You know, if every American who wanted a job had\none, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this\ncountry today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first\nstep to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country\nagain.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid\nfor over the life of our budget.\n             \n             Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how\nimportant the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.\n             \n             Good morning, and thank you for listening.\n\n                               END                 10:11 A.M. EDT\n\n\n\n",

I'm not going to apologize for pointing out\nthat your straw-man argument was a straw-man argument.  Nor for saying\nthat your list of \"bible contradictions\" shows such low standards of\nscholarship that it should be an embarrassment to anti-inerrantists,\njust as Josh McDowell should be an embarrassment to the fundies.  Nor\nfor objecting various times to your taking quotes out of context.  Nor\nfor pointing out that \"they do it too\" is not an excuse. Nor for calling\nyour red herrings and smoke screens what they are.\n\nI'm still not sure why you think I'm a hypocrite.  It's true that I\nhaven't responded to any of Robert Weiss' articles, which may be due in\npart to the fact that I almost never read his articles.  But I have\nresponded to both you and Frank DeCenso (a fundie/inerrantist.)  Both\nyou and Frank have taken quotes out of context, and I've objected to\nboth of you doing so.  I've criticized bad arguments both when they\nwere yours and I agreed with the conclusion (that the Bible is not\ninerrant), and when they were Frank's and I disagreed with the\nconclusion.  I've criticized both you and Frank for evading questions,\nand for trying to \"explain me away\" without addressing the objections\nI raise (you by accusing me of being hypocritical and irrational, Frank\nby accusing me of being motivated by a desire to attack the Bible.) I\ndon't see that any of this is hypocritical, nor do I apologize for it.\n\nI do apologize, however, for having offended you in any other way.\n\nHappy now?\n\ndj\n",

They must account for this...\n\nNow let me get this straight.  After a nice, long rant about how\npeople need to take personal responsibility for their economic and\nsocial lives, all of a sudden 1960's radicals (such as me, I guess)\nare responsible for poor people's lifestyles?  Tell me how that\nworks--or do you think that poor people are just too dumb to think\nfor themselves?\n\nThere are many reasons for the disintegration of the family and\nsupport systems in general among this nation's poor.  Somehow I\ndon't think Murphy Brown--or Janis Joplin--is at the top of any \nsane person's list.\n\nYou want to go after my generation's vaunted cultural revolution for\na lasting change for the worse, try so-called \"relevant\" or \"values\"\neducation.  Hey, it seemed like a good idea at the time.  How were\nwe to know you needed a real education first--I mean, we took that\nfor granted.\n\n               *** ***\nKen Perlow   ***** *****\n05 Apr 93   ****** ******   16 Germinal An CCI\n            *****   *****   gadfly@ihspc.att.com\n             ** ** ** **\n...L'AUDACE!   *** ***   TOUJOURS DE L'AUDACE!

He must have been abused by a man and is\n] living his life in an attempt to vilify all men who like sex with other men\n] something slightly similar to the way his assailant liked it with him. He\n] will alter or misrepresent anything he finds to try to prove that there are\n] homosexuals who wish to rape little boys like he was coming out of the\n] woodwork. There is no hope for him. In all probability he is secretly gay,\n] which compounds his neurosis in his own mind, by thinking that someone else\n] made him that way. I don't personally see how someone like him could walk\n] and chew gum at the same time, as mentally crippled and dominated as he is\n] by his fantasies.\n] \n] He would have you believe that the figures on the percentage of people who\n] like to do it with the same sex sometime or all the time is way smaller\n] than it is, but then he will virtually assert that everyone's queer and\n] they're trying to get him. He actually believes, despite all evidence that\n] homosexuals do some huge disproportionate amount of child sexual abuse,\n] even though he insists that there may be as few as 1% of them in the male\n] population! If there were that few of them in the population, San Francisco\n] would currently be empty, because a significant portion of them have sought\n] a tolerant atmosphere in that city, and the numbers simply do not work when\n] you add up their home town origins. There is nothing to be gained by\n] communicating with Clayton Cramer, he is unable to listen to anyone.\n] -RSW\n] \n] \n] --\n] * Richard STEVEn Walz   rstevew@deeptht.armory.com   (408) 429-1200  *\n] * 515 Maple Street #1   * Without safe and free abortion women are   *\n] * Santa Cruz, CA 95060    organ-surrogates to unwanted parasites.*   *\n] * Real Men would never accept organ-slavery and will protect Women.  *\n\nSorry, but I don't see how the response applies to what was posted.\n\nUnless I am badly mistaken, Rohit is suggesting that protecting boys\nfrom men is different than protecting girls from men. There are situations\nin which boys and girls are apart from members of the *opposite* sex\n(due to social convention or whatever) and thus are safe (in at least\nsome sense). These same situations don't (necessarily) protect the\nchildren from abuse by members of the *same* sex.\n\nIf we can understand that, it's not such a tremendous leap to suggest\nthat if we all think about it hard, *someone* may come up with a\npractical solution (or even a partial solution) to some of the situations\nin which children are made vulnerable to homosexuals who wish to abuse\nthem. By working together \"with good will on both sides\", we may be\nable to start solving problems without restricting anyone's freedoms.\n\nMr. Walz on the other hand is using Rohit's post as an excuse for\npersonal attacks on Mr. Cramer. While Mr. Walz hasn't (by a *long*\nstretch) been the only one to flame Mr. Cramer, it is no less childish\nand it only serves to weaken any other arguments he may make in the\nfuture.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nRick Roy       Usenet: rick@howtek.MV.com       America Online: QED\nDisclaimer: My employer's views are orthogonal to these.\nThe early bird got worms.\n",

As a \nleft-wing, big government, conventional liberal, I'm just as willing as\nyou are to vote against anti-competitive regulations that favor auto\ndealers.  \n\nBut what I hear from libertarians is a desire to limit incumbents' terms,\nto weaken government by eliminating its power to enforce antitrust laws,\nand a desire to eliminate legislator's pay.  Each strikes me as a \nparticularly ineffective way to insure that auto dealers and other special\ninterests cannot influence public policy.  In fact, they seem clearly\ndesigned to accomplish the opposite.\n\njsh\n>\n>=Mark\n--\nSteve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM   \n\"One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh\n the bulls**t.\" - R.

Do the gases really \n>compress that much?\n\n    For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses\nin the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.\n\n1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force\nair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake\nvalve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only\nthe difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after\nthe exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the\nintake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing\natmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time\ndoes the pressure ever become \"negative\", or even approach a good\nvacuum.\n\n2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the\ncombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up\nto the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume\nof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume\nthat must flow through the intake, because of the temperature\ndifference and the products of combustion.\n\n3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started\npaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty\nhorsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,\nsubstitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost\nzero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very\nwell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make\nvery little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is\n_much_ louder than the stocker.\n\n4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.\nIf free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference\nwas noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.\n\n5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.

Question is, why channel\nTD>12 and 32?\n\nThe best antenna is one that will let out the most wave (probably not the \nbest explanation, but the rest makes sense) A one wave will cancell itself \nout (BTW no such beastie) . The best is a 1/2 wave antenna, followed by \n1/4, then 1/8 etc.\n\nAs for SWRing in, what you actually do is trim the antenna to the correct \nlength for the specific wavelength you will be transmitting on. Since the \nwavelength varies with the channel you use, then it's recommended to SWR \nin using the middle channel of those you are going to use.\nAnyway in the beginning of CB's, all new antennas had to be SWR'ed in, \nnowdays manufactures trim the antennas almost spot on, so that there's not \nmuch point in SWRing.

                  "\nMy previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or\nsomething. I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the\napproved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target,\nthen take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it\ndidn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my\nhouse, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to\nthe Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to\nthe Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to\nharm.\n\nBut I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the\nroughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph\nfor the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the\nleft side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he\nhad been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away,\nheading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I\nsaw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took\nthe dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was\ndriven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent\nmarks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think\nI saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this\nmoment is hazy.\n\nI next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The\napologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut\nmouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my\nshin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not.\nSo I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!\n\nInterestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never\nmoved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike\noff course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some\ngut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me\nhere, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.\n\nWhat worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have\nprevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not\nnecessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was\nriding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if\nit had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the\nthought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a\nblind driveway at 15-30 mph.

What\n>stupidity gene makes this so difficult?  \"I'd like to buy the world a\n>clue...\"\n\n\n\tThe word that is missing in this whole discourse is not the \"B\"\nword, or the \"H\" word, or even the \"N\" or \"W\" words. It is the \"L\" word -\nLOSER !!\n\n\tThat's right. When we boil all the crap out of this argument, it\nis all about WINNING and LOSING, and nothing else. Let me explain.\n\n\tRemember the eighties ? No excuses. Nobody who can handle a mail\nbuffer can claim they are \"too young\" to remember Ronald Reagan - yet.\nThe eighties were about \"How America Learned to Win Once Again\". Then\n(wouldn't you know), we won so well that there was nothing left to win.\nNo Cold War to endure. No nuclear holocaust. No more worlds to conquer\n(We forgot about outer space long ago). The kind of overwhelming, no\nholds barred success that killed Alexander the Great. Yes, there were a\nfew \"little\" problems along the way - stock market meltdown here, an\nS&L bailout there, a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators to\ncontend with, but as Tacitus would tell ya', the God Augustus never had\nit so good. \n\n\tIn the meantime, there is guilt for winning, maybe a fear that one\ndoesn't deserve one's bounty - or success. So there is a \"kinder and gentler\ntype of politician these days, Bill Clinton, affirmative action, and lots of\ndiscourse about people who \"don't get it\". For those of us in the winning\nbusiness, this kind of talk is mildly irritating, but there is still no \nsuggestion of losing.\n\n\tBut what do we find now ? To put it mildy, the stereotype of our \n\"white male\" non-winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl, punching out \nphotojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another one\nwith a \"Hail Mary\" pass in the Fourth Quarter. (The whole idea behind 'three\nyards and a cloud of dust' is to wear your opponent down until he collapses\nin the final period) But Woody just used his fists - Uzzies seem to be the \nweapon of choice these days. \n\t\n\tWho is D-FENS, anyway ? The answer is as plain as the horn rims on \nyour face. The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS, posing as a LOSER. This \nis known as controversial casting. But that baggy short-sleeved white shirt \nsure does look natural on Mike doesn't it. Gordon Gekko will never look the \nsame. (Though Woody always dressed that way.) Did we really expect Gekko to \ntake it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ?\n\n\tWhat we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing D-FENS is \nthe same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood\nused to blow away all the time. As that arch-WASP (male gender) George C. Scott\ndeclaimed, \"Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN. They love a winner, and will \nnot tolerate a loser.\" And so on. \n\n\tThe political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - and\nDemocrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some \n\"equitable\" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a \nloser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asian\nhomosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined\nday when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%) \nminority.\n\n\tOr you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do most\nconservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn't care\nwho's winning and who's losing. In some cases, you might say something\nabout make sure the game is fair (equality of opportunity, not of condition).\nIn the latter case, you might be able to identify yourself as a \n\"neoconservative\" or a \"neoliberal\" depending on how much you want to limit\nthe pot.\n\n\tEither way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be\npopular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you'll still\nbe popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I \nwould imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it\nis the only way to go. (Even in Hollywood, which treats Losers worse than any\nother place in America except for New York and Washington, D.C. - and even in\nColumbus, Ohio, which produced Alex Keaton, but no champion football teams in\nthe eighties and the first quarter of the nineties) I'd like to \nsee more Winners in this society, regardless of race, gender, religious \npreference, and sexual orientation. Maybe we should even let a few more of \nthem be white men !!

The noise you hear is due to the momentary\nopening and closing of the path.\n\nThe noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high\nimpedance audio circuits a resistive \"T\" is constructed close to characteristic\nimpedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers\nthe audio.\n\nIn low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are\nshorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic\nimpedance.\n\nSometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used\nto momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.\n\nTelephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to \"Make before\nbreak and Vica Versa\" but I haven't seen any of these for years.\n\nNowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.\n\nA novel circuit I used to build was a primitive \"optical isolator\".. It consists\nof a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is\noff the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers\npassing the audio.  Once again this device in a \"T\" switches the audio.  Varying\nthe lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and\nyou have a mixer!\n\nLots of luck!\n-- \n73, Tom\n================================================================================\nTom Wagner, Audio Visual Technician.

In consulting\na 1989 World Almanac, I see that 1% of abortions in 1983 were done at \n21 weeks or more.

                  "\nFor an upcoming project I want to use 4 Megs of DRAM configured as two 2\nMeg banks of 16 bit data.  I was wondering if anyone out there knows of a\nDRAM controller which will handle refreshing the data.  It's ok if the\ncontroller doesn't handle bank switching - that part is easy.\n\nThe only controllers I know of are the ones out of the National\nSemiconductor DRAM Management Handbook (1988 edition) eg. DP8429.  I would\nlike to know if another manufacturer produces one which may be easier to\nimplement in my circuit.\n\nBTW, if anyone is wanting to hook up DRAM to a microcontroller, Dallas\nSemiconductor makes a neat chip: the DS1262 Serial DRAM Nonvolatizer\nChip.  It uses the SPI (I2C) bus and refreshes/controls up to 16Mx1 of DRAM\nmemory.  It can use an external battery to refresh the DRAM when the\npower is off.  Price is $11.75 from Dallas (quan 1).

                  "NNTP-Posting-Host: im4u.cs.utexas.edu\nKeywords: MITI\n\nI have a thermal fuse from a Apple Laserwriter II power supply (Made\nby Cannon) that I need to replace.  The fuse is not the standard\ntubular thermal fuse like those found in hair driers etc, but is a \nrectangular plastic package, much like a transistor or diode.  It\nis about 0.2\"x0.2\"x0.1\", with both leads coming out of one of the\n0.1\"x0.1\" sides.  I have been told that it was made by MITI, a asian\ncompany, but I can find no information as to a supplier.  This fuse\nis rated at 1A, 130C.  Does anyone have a source for this fuse?  I\nonly need 5 or so, which means that the manufacturer wouldn't even want\nto talk to me, let alone, deal with me.\n\nPlease advise via E-mail.\n\nThanks,\nPat\n\n-- \n---  I like boats and bicycles, they're healthier than Valium  ---\nPat Horne, Network Manager, Shop Supervisor, Hardware Guru \nCS Dept, University of Texas, Austin, Tx. 78712 USA \nvoice (512)471-9517, fax (512)471-8885, UUCP:cs.utexas.edu!horne\n",

While this \"Banner\" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the \"Environmental\nBillboard\".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the \"Environmental\nBillboard\" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable 'frame'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry \"ozone reading\nsensors\" to \"continuously monitor the condition of the Earth's\ndelicate protective ozone layer,\" according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth's\natmosphere. According to IMI, \"as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer.\" The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and \"adds to the ozone supply.\"\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising 'unit' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian's questions:\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the \"wild\n>idea\" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it's probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can't piggy back upon\nsomeone else's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That's a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don't think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don't really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\nidiot?)\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it's in a low\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that's the time\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven't heard of any serious funding\nfor this, but I'm sure they are shopping the venture around looking\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\n  \n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\nmy guest.  I don't have posting privileges to that area (or at least\nI don't THINK I do...).\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n",

                  "Distribution: usa\nNNTP-Posting-Host: tomato.cis.ohio-state.edu\n\n\nHi all,\n\nI'm an assistant manager at a local art theater here in Columbus.  I'd\nlike to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to\nuse cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automation\nconsoles date from the early 60's and don't provide this function.\n\nWe already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes,\nand our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control\ncircuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.\n\nI've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when the\ncue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there's one\nproblem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be\na sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute,\nso to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid\ncuetape!)\n\nIdeally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function.\n(A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film)\nThis would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second.\nWhat I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay\nfor around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relay\nis activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuit\nof some sort.  I'm sure some of you already have the solution figured\nout in your heads.  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated!\n\n\nThanks,\n\nMark Fontana\n\n-- \n \"Of all the arts, the cinema is  |  Mark A.

                  "\njeh@cmkrnl.com writes:\n>\n>Hmmm.  How are those orange \"isolated ground\" outlets (often used in\n>computer rooms) wired?  \n\nThey require two separate grounds.  One ground goes to the ground pin\nof the outlet, and the other ground wire is connected to the outlet's\nmounting tabs (and thus grounds the box and faceplate screw and metal\nfaceplate, if any).\n\nThe box/faceplate ground goes to the normal distribution panel ground.\nThe outlet ground-pin wire is generally connected to an insulated\nbusbar in the distribution panel which is, in turn, connected to\nthe building-entrance main ground by its own wire.\n\nSo the two separate ground systems are connected together at the\nbuilding's service entrance.  But one is also connected to every\ngrounded piece of electrical equipment in the whole building,\nwhile the isolated ground is shared only by the equipment plugged\ninto isolated-ground outlets of that panel.  If someone happens\nto accidentally short one phase of a 600V feeder to ground,\nthe main building ground is likely to have a lot of noise on it\nuntil the breaker trips or the fuse blows, while the isolated\nground will remain relatively noise-free.\n",

The prefix \"peri-\" is Greek, not Latin, so it's usually used\nwith the Greek form of the name of the body being orbited.  (That's why\nit's \"perihelion\" rather than \"perisol\", \"perigee\" rather than \"periterr\",\nand \"pericynthion\" rather than \"perilune\".)  So for Jupiter I'd expect it\nto be something like \"perizeon\".)   :^)\n\n   ___            _                                           -  Bob\n   /__) _   /    / ) _   _\n(_/__) (_)_(_)  (___(_)_(/_______________________________________ bob@1776.COM\nRobert K.

If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked\nquestions that you would like included in this posting, send email to\nleech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).\n\n    If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' to\nyour KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreader\nthat can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).\n\n    The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down\nby rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in\nthe Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.\n\n    Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The\npoint of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old\nanswers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing\nthan rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided\nbecause they give more complete information than any short generalization.\n\n    Questions fall into three basic types:\n\n    1) Where do I find some information about space?\n\n    Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask\n    for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There\n    are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended\n    discussion.\n\n    2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?\n\n    Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been\n    thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for\n    evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.\n\n    3) Miscellanous queries.\n\n    These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of\n    FAQ postings.\n\n\n    SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE\n\n    Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet.\n    Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]\n    Edit \"Subject:\" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent.\n    Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth\n\t100 posts).\n    Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST\n\tnot SPACE.\n    Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all\n\treferences.)\n    Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you're\n\tresponding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!\n    Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail\n\tor article), state your institution, etc. Don't assume the\n\t'reply' function of mailers will work.\n    Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyone\n\twill get on TV anyway.\n    Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:\n\tkeep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals\n\t(use carriage returns).\n\n\n    INDEX TO LINKED POSTINGS\n\n    I've attempted to break the postings up into related areas. There isn't\n    a keyword index yet; the following lists the major subject areas in each\n    posting. Only those containing astronomy-related material are posted to\n    sci.astro (indicated by '*' following the posting number).\n\n    #\tContents\n\n    1*\tIntroduction\n\t    Suggestions for better netiquette\n\t    Index to linked postings\n\t    Notes on addresses, phone numbers, etc.\n\t    Contributors\n\n    2*\tNetwork resources\n\t    Overview\n\t    Mailing lists\n\t    Periodically updated information\n\t    Warning about non-public networks\n\n    3*\tOnline (and some offline) sources of images, data, etc.\n\t    Introduction\n\t    Viewing Images\n\t    Online Archives\n\t\tNASA Ames\n\t\tNASA Astrophysics Data System\n\t\tNASA Jet Propulsion Lab (Mission Information and Images)\n\t\tNASA Langley (Technical Reports)\n\t\tNASA Spacelink\n\t\tNational Space Science Data Center\n\t\tSpace Telescope Science Institute Electronic Info.

EDT\n\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that \nOctavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today \nabout why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to \nget a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature \nof learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of \npeople like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of \nthose who are here.  \n\t     \n\t     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education \nand all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my \ngood friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and \nall of the business and local community leaders from the city and \ncounty and state level from around America who are here. \n\t     \n\t     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved \nhearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is \ntheir future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A \nyear and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because \nI was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our \ncountry, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had \ntoo little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines \nof income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to \ntake us into the future.  \n\t     \n\t     I entered with the hope that together we could create \nmore opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of \nour people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of \nAmerica's community, knowing that together we could always to more \nthan we could individually and that we might secure our future.\n\t     \n\t     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 \njobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the \ncommitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, \nand those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs \ndoes, and the successes of all the young people like those on this \nstage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all \nthose things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're \non the right track.\n\t     \n\t     Last July when I was traveling across America's \nheartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in \nLouisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business \npeople who were participating in the Louisville Education and \nEmployment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  \nI saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed \nboth in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my \nown state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about \n-- that for millions of American young people it is really an \nimpediment to both their learning and their ability to be good \nworkers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what \nis learning.\n\t     \n\t     In the world in which we are living, the average young \nperson will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a \nlifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning \nworld much better.  And we must determine that all of our young \npeople see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased \nhere today.  \n\t     \n\t     Whether you're in business or in government or in \neducation, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to \nbuilding a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all \nof our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things \nare pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best \nthing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have \njobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  \n\t     \n\t     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty \ngood education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that \nthey'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either \npolitical or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great \nchallenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to \nfully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work \nfor them to do.\n\t     \n\t     All the European countries have higher unemployment \nrates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the \nunemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  \nThey're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its \nmost rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that \nI have proposed to create jobs. \n\t     \n\t     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now \nabout as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  \nIt costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of \npressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing \ntheir own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their \npeople.  \n\t     \n\t     But it is especially important for America for two \nreasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move \naggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be \ncompetitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, \neven if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed \nof the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to \nwork in this country.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some \nof it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and \nmoving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We \nhave now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big \norganizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they \nare organized and who ask whether there are too many people working \nat some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to \ncreate jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the \nchance to work.  \n\t     \n\t     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare \nreform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of \nmonths -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the \nend of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of \nthe American people to perform without regard to race or income or \nthe circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that \nthere are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their \ntalent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  \nI do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if \nyou want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more \nresponsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this \ncountry that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you \nhave got to have opportunity in that mix. \n\t     \n\t     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for \nevery young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules \nand work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be \nsomething at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are \nbasically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, \nrecognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of \nour people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their \nbackground.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's \nsomething there for them to do?\n\n\t     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an \nintegral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of \nwork and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people \nfirst, and it does have a partnership between the public and private \nsector.\n\t     \n\t     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in \nFebruary on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 \nextra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the \nAmerican business community to meet that target so that we can create  \nmore than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been \ncreated before.\n\t     \n\t     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And \nJerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in \nthis room and around the country -- people who are going to do more \nthan they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people \na work experience.  And it is terribly important.\n\t     \n\t     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is \npart of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the \nAmerican people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their \njobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving \nthe transition from school to work for young people who don't go to \ncollege but do need at least two years of post-high school training \neither on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, \nso that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more \npeople to go on to college who do want to go.\n\t     \n\t     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive \nplan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The \nemergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would \ncreate a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and \nthat would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It \nwould also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work \nforce in jobs that otherwise will not be created.\n\t     \n\t      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to \ninvest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --\nprojects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, \nnew industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities \n-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve \nthe environment.  \n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs program is an important part of that \nbecause we have tried for the first time, through the work of the \nLabor Department and the Education Department and through reaching \nout to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer \njobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to \nhopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young \npeople into further educational opportunities and to further job \nopportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component \nto these summer jobs -- something that the United States government \nhas never fully emphasized before.  \n\t     \n\t     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because \nthey come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in \ndifficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building \ntheir basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other \nareas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who \nhave difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what \nthey learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next \nyear.  \n\t     \n\t     What we are trying to do here is to give people the \nopportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning \nskills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next \ncouple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school \nin this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning \nenvironment.  \n\t     \n\t     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities \nfor people to learn and work during the school year, so that this \nwill not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will \nbe a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new \nwork experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.\n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-\nwork jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding \nthe job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help \nto build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve \nlocal problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public \nbuildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in \nhospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, \nand learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while \nthey earn, but letting them earn.\n\t     \n\t     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people \nwho have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should \ndo this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the \nopportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing \nin going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't \nexactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare \nsystem; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people \nto work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the \nuse of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if \nyou're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to \nreward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     The young people we propose to put to work under our \nprogram will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, \nreading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will \nstretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a \nsense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, \nbut a challenge that will take them into a different life.\n\t     \n\t     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even \nas I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the \nsummer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll \nsee whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer \nacademically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved \nahead.  I suspect that they will.  \n\t     \n\t     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I \nwill be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn \nfrom you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next \nsummer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school \nyear, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that \nwe do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so \nthat we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private \ninvestments as well. \n\t     \n\t     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the \nbusiness leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this \nsummer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business \nwho have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who \nhaven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about \nthis event today, I want to implore other private employers to \nstretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this \nsummer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when \nwe don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort \nthem to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up \nhere on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking \nabout work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've \ndone to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very \nfoolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand \nand sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had \never had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be \nworth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     That does not mean young people should not be \nentrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation \nahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and \nworked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  \nAnd I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some \npeople say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  \n\t     \n\t     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I \ngrew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul \nwithout regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a \njob.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to \npeople is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a \njob and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now \nI live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any \nmore money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're \nworking longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  \nAnd we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these \nyoung people want.\n\t     \n\t     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  \nIt doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration \npursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private \nsector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn \nhow to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created \nin this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done \noff-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a \nthird or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do \neconomically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of \nAmerica's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just \nkidding.  \n\t     \n\t     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy \ncountry in the world, including the United States, is having \ndifficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done \nI'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole \ndeliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the \nanswers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     And so the jobs program that I have presented to \nCongress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the \ncounties, through the Community Development Program, with the \ninfrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an \nattempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the \neconomy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little \nboost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a \nmillion jobs and maybe get the engine going again.\n\t     \n\t     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in \nthe private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government \nmoney.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American \neconomy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind \nof system we have and it works pretty well.  \n\t     \n\t     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you \nhere today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends \nand neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers \nto make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the \nfunds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government \nshould create this summer, so that together we can have this \npartnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a \nfuture -- a future that our young people can believe in.  \n\t     \n\t     We need to send them a message that here in America if \nyou study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute \nsomething to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  \nYou can build a future from you own dreams. \n\t     \n\t     That has always been the promise of America.  Together \nthat's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of \nthe promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise \nhas been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.\n\t     \n\t     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\n\n                                 END11:45 A.M. EDT\n\n\n\n",

That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,\n   but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing\n   military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than\n   just a \"we have the money, why not?\" approach.\n\nAh, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not\nwasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) bills\nto fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be\nspent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of funding\nhigh-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various\nfields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the\ndefense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to\nfund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-European\ncooperation.\n\nNow maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of\nmoney (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as\ninvestment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at\nthe size of that multiplier :->).\n\nNick Haines nickh@cmu.edu\n",

I don't\n>have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:\n>\n>[...]  Any stories on how you all learned?\n\nI'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.\n\nEarly in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on\nhis old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I\nactually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.\n\nI proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and\nrode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to\ninvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then\nI also passed my road test.\n\nOn May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a\n4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),\nI had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,\nskidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the\noncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was\nalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under\na car and been killed.\n\nNow this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the\nExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training\ncould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater\nsince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff\nas I did.\n\nSo my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I\nwouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you\nhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until\nyou're ready to use it.\n\n>1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have \n>to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too \n>ignorant to know I need to buy)\n\nWhile you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in\nDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you\nsave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,\nplus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure\nthe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up\nmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration\nand licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not\nincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.\n\n>2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in \n>about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up\n>till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a \n>motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes\n>a difference)\n\nI pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200\nin Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial\ncoverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be\npoor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo\nmore expensive.\n\n>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?\n\nThere used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle\nmagazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or\nrecent models might be available.  You could probably look through\npast issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first\nbike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice\ninstead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that\nare parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by\nnoticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around\nand they were generally set up the way I wanted.\n\nNothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting\nshowrooms.

                  "Organization: University of Waterloo\n\nHi, I just have a small question about my bike. \nBeing a fairly experienced BMW and MZ-Mechanic, I just don't know what to \nthink about my Honda. \nShe was using too much oil for the last 5000 km (on my trip to Daytona bike \nweek this spring), and all of a sudden, she trailed smoke like hell and \nwas running only on one cylinder. \nI towed the bike home and took it apart, but everything looks in perfect \nworking order. No cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look \nvery clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. All \nstill within factory specs. The only thing I could find, however, was a \nslightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder (the one with the problem), \nbut it is still way below the wear-limit given in the Clymer-manual for \nthis bike. \nAny syggestions??? What else could cause my problem??? Do I have to hone \nthe cylinder walls (make them a little rougher in a criss-cross-pattern) in \norder to get better breaking in of my new rings??? Won't that increase the \nwear of my pistons??\nPlease send comments to \n\tsruhl@mechanical.watstar.uwaterloo.ca\nThanks in advance.

EDT\n             \n             \n             THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  My voice is coming to\nyou this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio\nstation in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to\nmeet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,\nhealth care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly\nbroadcast with the American people. \n             \n             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when\nit reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past\nseven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with\nthe people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus\ntour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last\nyear's campaign.\n             \n             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with\nyou, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and\nwhat I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting\nto you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.\n             \n             You sent me to Washington to get our government and\neconomy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad\nexperiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important\nit is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do\nbusiness.  \n             \n             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations\nrise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness\nof their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the\ncooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,\nlabor and government.  Although many of the economies of the\nindustrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've\nmade many of the smart investments and the tough choices which\nour government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them\nhave been moving ahead and too many of our people have been\nfalling behind.\n             \n             We have an economy today that even when it grows is\nnot producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation\nby four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to\nshow for it.  We know that wages of most working people have\nstopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks\nand that too many families can no longer afford the escalating\ncost of health care.\n             \n             But we also know that, given the right tools, the\nright incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and\nbusinesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy\nneeds to expand opportunity and to make our communities better\nplaces to live.\n             \n             In many critical products today Americans are the\nlow cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that\nwe create more of those kinds of jobs.\n             \n             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for\nlong-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old\npriorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to\nbe -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs\nand education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the\nwaste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious\nresources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the\ngroundwork for robust economic growth in the future.\n             \n             These new directions passed the Congress in record\ntime and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our\ncountry.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would\ncreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private\nsector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It\nnow has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. \nBut it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the\nSenate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know\nwould result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.\n             \n             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. \nMillions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and\ncounting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill\nhas been grounded by gridlock.  \n             \n             I know the American people are tired of business as\nusual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin\nor wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have\ntaken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra\nmile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25\npercent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  \n             \n             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million\nAmericans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill\nlanguish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean\nhundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to\nact to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking\nthis initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I\nthink we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant\nportion of our original goals.\n             \n             First, we want to keep the programs as much as\npossible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,\nincluding highway and road construction, summer jobs for young\npeople, immunization for children, construction of waste water\nsites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding\nfor extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who\nhave been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't\ncreating jobs.\n             \n             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs\nin the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40\npercent.\n             \n             And third, I've recommended a new element in this\nprogram to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against\ncrime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire\npolice officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put\nthem back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight\nfor a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it\nand deserve it.\n             \n             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --\nthe Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it\nincreases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this\nyear that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,\ndoesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more\nthan paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this\nbudget is well within the spending limits already approved by the\nCongress this year.\n             \n             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators\nwho are filibustering the bill voted during the previous\nadministration for billions of dollars of the same kind of\nemergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the\nAmerican people to work.  \n             \n             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered\na plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities\nare -- on people or on politics.  \n             \n             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar\nfor dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the\nsoundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our\nchildren.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs\nand investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of\nus when we've helped make more American partners working to\nensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.\n             \n             You know, if every American who wanted a job had\none, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this\ncountry today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first\nstep to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country\nagain.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid\nfor over the life of our budget.\n             \n             Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how\nimportant the bill is.

This is simply an ad hominum\nattack and you know it.\n\n> \n>Your employer DOES charge a fee. You may not see it but you do.\n>\n\nOf course there is a fee. It is for administration. Geez Allen any\norganization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in  legitimate\ncosts, such as libraries and other things that must be there to support\na program and \"wrap\" as you originally stated it.You stated that wrap\nwas on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you\nsay is not true. Which is it Allen?\n\n>>>Sounds like they are adding it to their overhead rate. Go ask your\n>>>costing people how much fee they add to a project.\n> \n>>I did they never heard of it but suggest that, like our president did, that\n>>any percentage number like this is included in the overhead.\n> \n>Well there you are Dennis. As I said, they simply include the fee in\n>their overhead. Many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can\n>change depending on the customer.\n>\n\nAs you have posted on this subject Allen, you state that wrap is over and\nabove overhead and is a seperate charge. You admit here that this is wrong.\nNasa has a line item budget every year. I have seen it Allen. Get some\nnumbers from that detailed NASA budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then\nhowl to high heaven about it. Until you do that you are barking in the wind.\n\n>>No Allen you did not. You merely repeated allegations made by an Employee\n>>of the Overhead capital of NASA. \n> \n>Integration, Dennis, isn't overhead.\n> \n>>Nothing that Reston does could not be dont\n>>better or cheaper at the Other NASA centers  where the work is going on.\n>\n\nIntegration could be done better at the centers. Apollo integration was \ndone here at Msfc and that did not turn out so bad. The philosophy of\nReston is totally wrong Allen. There you have a bunch of people who are\ncompletely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. There\nis no way that will ever work. It has never worked in any large scale project\nthat it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for \nApollo?\n\n>Dennis, Reston has been the only NASA agency working to reduce costs. When\n>WP 02 was hemoraging out a billion $$, the centers you love so much where\n>doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem. Reston was the\n>only place you would find people actually interested in solving the\n>problems and building a station.\n>\n\nOh you are full of it Allen on this one. I agree that JSC screwed up big.\nThey should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it\nreplaced. To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your\nbias goes. Come to MSFC for a couple of weeks and you will find out just\nhow wrong you really are. Maybe not, people like you believe exactly what\nthey want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it. \n\n>>Kinda funny isn't it that someone who talks about a problem like this is\n>>at a place where everything is overhead.\n> \n>When you have a bit more experience Dennis, you will realize that\n>integration isn't overhead. It is the single most important part\n>of a successful large scale effort.\n>\n\nI agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful\nlarge scale effort. What I completly disagree with is seperating that\nintegration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called\nleadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for\nthe success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership\nand responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up\nas Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC\nand they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to\nfinally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the\nprocess then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.\n\nThere is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that\nfor a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the\nturn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is\nlack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of\nleadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a\nsymptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your\nefforts that you do not see this.\n\n>>Why did the Space News artice point out that it was the congressionally\n>>demanded change that caused the problems? Methinks that you are being \n>>selective with the facts again.\n> \n>The story you refer to said that some NASA people blamed it on\n>Congress. Suprise suprise. The fact remains that it is the centers\n>you support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn't address\n>the problems until the press published the story.\n> \n>Are you saying the Reston managers where wrong to get NASA to address\n>the overruns? You approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns?\n>\n\nNo, I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have \nhappened in the first place.\n\n>>If it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost\n>>of 500 million a flight then you pay 2 billion a year. You stated that your\n>>\"friend\" at Reston said that with the current station they could resupply it\n>>for a billion a year \"if the wrap were gone\". This merely points out a \n>>blatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail to see.\n> \n>You should know Dennis that NASA doesn't include transport costs for\n>resuply. That comes from the Shuttle budget. What they where saying\n>is that operational costs could be cut in half plus transport.\n> \n>>Sorry gang but I have a deadline for a satellite so someone else is going\n>>to have to do Allen's math for him for a while.

Acts 15 says \nthat no more should be layed on the Gentiles than that which is necessary.\nThe sabbath is not in the list, nor do any of the epistles instruct people\nto keep the 7th day, while Christians were living among people who did not\nkeep the 7th day.  It looks like that would have been a problem.\n\nInstead, we have Scriptures telling us that all days can be esteemed alike\n(Romans 14:5) and that no man should judge us in regard to what kind of\nfood we eat, Jewish holy days we keep, or _in regard to the sabbath.

Therefore, Lunar bases should be predicated on funding\nlevels little different from those found for Antarctic bases. Can you\nput a 200 person base on the Moon for $30 million a year?

The two stage version\nwas used for the first 3 launches, while the 3 and 4 stage versions are used\ntoday.  The four stage version is used mostly for escape (and geosynchronous?)\norbits, while the 3 stage version is used for low earth orbits.

I sometimes choose to ride without a helmet or\n\tlacking other safety gear (depends on how squidly I feel) but I\n\twon't let passengers do it. What I do to myself I can handle, but\n\tI wouldn't want to hurt anyone else, so I don't let them on without\n\tgloves, jacket, (at least) jeans, heavy boots, and a helmet that *fits*\n\n>I really want this to be a positive experience for us both, mainly so that\n>she'll want to go with me again, so any help will be appreciated...\n\n\tGo *real* easy. It's amazing how solid a grip you have on the\n\thandle bars that your passenger does not. Don't make her feel like\n\tshe's going to slide off the back, and \"snappy\" turns for you are\n\tsickening lurches for her. In general, it feels much less controlled\n\tand smooth as a passenger.

I agree with that.  But what does that have to do with Jesus?\nPunishment you say?  Jesus did not regard his death as punishment. \n\n>I've tried repeatedly over the course of several years\n>to accept it, but I just can't. \n\nGood.  I wouldn't either--not the way you understand it.  \n\n>If you can explain to me why the death of Jesus was a *good* thing,\n>then I would be very glad to hear it, and you might even convert me.\n>Be warned, however, that I've heard all the most common arguments\n>before, and they just don't convince me.\n\nAsk Jesus himself.  He himself said why in John 12:23-32.  It\nisn't a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for\na persuasive argument.   Read Jesus's own reply to your\nquestion.\n\nJesus gives more reasons in John 16:7.  But one obvious reason\nwhy Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with\nhis punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that\nwe would \"stop doubting and believe\" (John 21:27).  The fact\nthat Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise\nfrom the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it.\nWithout this obvious point, I would have no hope\nand my faith would be vanity.\n\nWhy did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus\nsays why in John 15:18-25.   That's no mystery either.  \"The\nworld hates him without reason.\"  It is a direct proclamation\nof how far we humans botch things up and thus, how much we\nneed a Saviour.\n\nAnd why can't you, Brian K., accept this?  How can you?  \"The\nworld cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows\nhim.\"  (John 14:17).   The animosity and the lack of knowledge\nthat comes out in your twistings of Robert's daily verses is\nvery convincing testimony of the truth of John 14:17 and 16:25.\nI pray and hope that I do blurt out such animosity and lack of\nknowledge. I am not perfect either.

You examine the predicitions\nthat the theory makes, and try to observe them.  If you don't, or if you\nobserve things that the theory predicts wouldn't happen, then you have some \nevidence against the theory.  If the theory can't be modified to \nincorporate the new observations, then you say that it is false.\n\nFor example, people used to believe that the earth had been created\n10,000 years ago.

Do you see any flaws in this?\n\nThe problem is, your use of the word \"objective\" along with \"values.\"\nBoth definitions three and four are inherently subjective, that is\nthey are particular to a given individual, or personal. You see,\nwhat one person may see as worthwhile, another may see as worthless.\n\n>If on the other hand, some things *have* objective worth, usefulness,\n>or importance, it would be interesting to know what they are.\n\nAgain, your form of measurement in this sentence, that being of \"worth\"\nis subjective. \n\n>#If you can provide an objective foundation for \"morality\" then that will\n>#be a good beginning.\n\n>I'm not willing to attempt this until someone provides an objective\n>basis for the notion that science is useful, worthy, or important in\n>dealing with observed facts.  Alternatively, you could try to\n>demonstrate to me that science is not necessarily useful, worthy\n>or important in any situation.   In other words, I need to know\n>how you use the term \"objective\".\n\nWhen I find that my usage of a word is different than the usage of\nthat word given by another person, I try to find a standard against\nwhich to judge that usage. In most cases, the dictionary is the standard\nI use. Here is a definiton of objective:\n\nobjective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as \ndistinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existance.\n3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on\nobservable phenomenon.\n\nBy this definition, science does not have an objective worth, since the\nphrase \"objective worth\" is an oxymoron. However you asked something a \nlittle differently this time, you asked for an objective basis for a\nnotion. The fact that the use of science as an intellectual tool is\nresponsible for changes in our world (the changes are material, and\nthus \"objective\") would provide an objective _basis_ for an argument.\nHowever, the conclusion arrived at from that argument (that science is \n\"good\") is subjective.\n\nI think that the problem here is one of word usage. Take a little time\nand read the definitions of these words: objective, subjective, worth,\nvalue, morality, good, evil. I believe that if you think about the \nmeaning of them for a while, you will have to conclude that there is no\nsuch thing as an objective morality.\n\n>Frank O'Dwyer                                  'I'm not hatching That'\n>odwyer@sse.ie                                  from \"Hens\",  by Evelyn Conlon\n\neric\n",

One approach is simply to try and move political opinion\nand hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a while.  Another\napproach is to try and amend the constitution.  The original\nconstitution restrained the U.S. government from economic intervention\nfor 100 to 150 years, depending on just how one wants to count it.\nThe First Amendment, though weakened in many ways, still restrains\ngovernment (particularly state and local), even though on many\nparticular issues the majority is in favor of censorship.  I think\nlibertarians would be happy with another 100 years of restraint via\nan amendment or two (not that I think that's likely to happen).\n\nNot necessarily Mr. Hendricks, but other posters seem to see this as\na problem with libertarianism, that it cannot be stable.  That might\nbe true, but it is not an objection to libertarianism per se.  If\na libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and then\nfalls apart again, we would just be back where we are now.

                  "Nntp-Posting-Host: ccsua.ctstateu.edu\nOrganization: Yale University, Department of Computer Science, New Haven, CT\n\nI told some friends of mine two weeks ago that Koresh was dead.  The FBI and\nthe BATF could not let a man like that live.  He was a testimonial to their\nstupidity and lies.    \n\nNow before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as \na bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.\n\nThey told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet, \nwhoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into\ntown on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and \nwondered why they didn't pick him up then.  There are two possible answers.\nFirst, they didn't see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, they\ndidn't care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they got\nit.\n\nAfter the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were\ncoming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that.\nWell, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.\n\nDid they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According to\nthem they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised\nKoresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                 \n The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he\nsaid:\n\n\"A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out.\nHis grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh's Real name)  she didn't raise\nDavid Koresh.\"\n\nSomeone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a\nlogical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.\n\nHere's another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that\nthey feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must\nbe done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?\n\nI knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how\nmuch money this was costing.  That was the start of the \"Justification\" part\npart of the plan.  That's when I knew it would come soon.\n\nBut, back to the plan.  It is considered \"Cruel and Unusal Punishment\" to\nexecute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what's acceptable.\n\nThey knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not\nsure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the \ncompound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were\nsupposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.\n\nI spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR\n(Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training\nis going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were\nsubjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical \nagent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.\n\nI have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of\nthing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.\n\nWe waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these\npeople 51 days.  \n\nI stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole\nthing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks\nchanged my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:\n\n\"And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the\noperation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal\nshot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt.\"\n\nIt took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.\n\nOne more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic\nweapons on the premises. \n                                                      \n        HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN!\n\nTHEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE. THEY ALSO KNEW HE HAD IT LEGALLY!\n\nStill, without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him.\nFor all of this my President takes full responsibility.  What a guy!\nI hope he gets it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn article <exuptr.1431.0@exu.ericsson.se>, exuptr@exu.ericsson.se (Patrick Taylor, The Sounding Board) writes:\n> In article <11974@prijat.cs.uofs.edu> bill@triangle.cs.uofs.edu (Bill Gunshannon) writes:\n> \n>>Before you go absolving the BATF & FBI of all blame in this incident, you should\n>>probably be aware of two important facts.\n>>1.

Hence, I find it difficult to\n}understand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite.  Needless to say, I don't\n}have time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m. that takes a quote\n}out of context.  \n\nOf course not - just the ones you disagree with.  Q.E.D.\n\n}>}So, according to you, Jim, the only way to criticize one person for\n}>}taking a quote out of context, without being a hypocrite, is to post a\n}>}response to *every* person on t.r.m who takes a quote out of context?\n}\n}Jim replied by saying \n}>Did I either ask or assert that?\n}\n}But today we find four articles from Jim, one of which has the subject\n\nSo?  As of then, and pointing out a specific instance.  Wrongo again.\n\n}>Is it not the case that, in the eyes of the law, when someone is aware of\n}>something and has the capability of taking action and does not, that individual\n}>may be held responsible for that action?\n}\n}Which is, of course, a complete red herring.  Taking quotes out of\n}context isn't a crime.  I don't have time to read every article on\n}t.r.m., and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all.\n\nSo?  Check the newsgroups?\n\n}Does \"silence is concurrence\" imply that Jim thinks that because I\n}didn't respond to Weiss' articles I must condone Weiss' taking quotes\n}out of context?  Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this\n}question; read what he has written and decide for yourself.\n\nTelepathy again?  You claim to know what I \"want\".\n\n}But back to the context of my conversation with Jim.  Jim's next \n}gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he\n}concluded that I was being a hypocrite.  I challenged him to provide\n}the details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion.\n\nNo.  YOu asked specifically what was wrong with yours.\n\n}Today we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn't help\n\nMaybe to the ignorant.  I accept your classification.\n\n}More red herrings.  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large\n}number of my articles?  \n\nDo you know what \"uncountably large\" means?  It does not appear so.\n\n}Could Jim mean that because I \"axed\" his articles,\n}but not Weiss' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ...\n}Well, I can't see where he is going with this.\n\nI am not suprised.\n\n}But I can help him with his induction.  I've written roughly 80\n\nThat does not appear to be the case.  The appearance of your \"Argument\"\nis more like that Captain Kirk would have gotten from Mr. Spock - written\nby a stagehand at Paramount.\n\n}Think hard about this Jim.  See the pattern?

Christian and Islamic fundamentalists put advancing there\nreligion above all else, even if doing so violates the religion itself.\n\nP.S.

He himself said why in John 12:23-32.  It\n>isn't a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for\n>a persuasive argument.   Read Jesus's own reply to your\n>question.\n\nJohn 12:24-26: \"Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat\nfalls onto the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it\nproduces much grain.\n  \"He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in\nthis world will keep it for eternal life.\n  \"If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My\nservant will be also.  If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor.\"\n\nWhy would I want an eternal life if I hate this one?\n\nIf we were created by a deity, why would that deity not wish us to\nenjoy what he has given us?\n\nWhy would I want to live forever?  The challenge in my life is that I\nwill die, and that I must give my life the meaning I wish it to have\nbefore that happens.  My time is here and will someday pass; I will be\ncontent to live on in the memories of my friends, and once they too\nare dead, then I will no longer have any reason to exist.\n\nIn short: even if your deity *does* exist, that doesn't automatically\nmean that I would worship it.  I am content to live my own life, and\nfend for myself, so when I die, I can be proud of the fact that no\nmatter where I end up, it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices.\n\nIf your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this, then so be\nit.  I would much rather just cease to exist.  But if your god wants\nmy respect and my obedience, then it had better earn these; and if it\ndoes, then they will be very strong and true.\n\n>Jesus gives more reasons in John 16:7.  But one obvious reason\n>why Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with\n>his punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that\n>we would \"stop doubting and believe\" (John 21:27).  The fact\n>that Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise\n>from the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it.\n>Without this obvious point, I would have no hope\n>and my faith would be vanity.\n\nJesus wasn't the only one who rose from the dead -- I think it was\nOsiris who did the same, as well as a few characters from Greek or\nNorse legend, if memory serves.\n\nBut still: WHY would I want to rise from the dead?  Why do *you* want to?\n\n>Why did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus\n>says why in John 15:18-25.   That's no mystery either.  \"The\n>world hates him without reason.\"  It is a direct proclamation\n>of how far we humans botch things up and thus, how much we\n>need a Saviour.\n\nIf your god wants to win my devotion, then it knows what it can do --\nprovide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind\nfaith that could be applied equally well to any religion.\n\n>And why can't you, Brian K., accept this?  How can you?  \"The\n>world cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows\n>him.\"  (John 14:17).\n\nThat's precisely it.  I neither see nor know Zeus either, nor Odin.\nShall I offer them the same devotion I offer Jesus?\n\n>The animosity and the lack of knowledge\n>that comes out in your twistings of Robert's daily verses is\n>very convincing testimony of the truth of John 14:17 and 16:25.\n\nYou've got to understand my point-of-view: I see Christians spouting\nBible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that\nwill level all opposition.  Truth is, it's not.  Robert has never\ndemonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; he\njust rattles them off day by day.  Some brazenly fly in the face of\ncommon sense and reality, and I point these out where I can.\n\nBut even more than that, even when Christians *do* try to explain the\nverses in their own words, they do so from a Christian point of view,\nwhich is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only\nhe or she understood the Christian message properly, and then all\nstrife and suffering on the earth would end.  Here's the problem with\nthat: substitute \"Moslem\" or \"Buddhist\" or \"Satanist\" instead of\n\"Christian\", and it means the same thing.\n\nChristanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.  But if\nyou want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the REAL WORLD,\nyou've got some convincing to do.\n\n>I pray and hope that I do blurt out such animosity and lack of\n>knowledge. I am not perfect either.  But regardless of that, I thank\n>God that Jesus revealed himself to me, without whom I'd also be\n>bumbling about blindly though arrogantly slandering the very\n>Person who created me and who loves me.\n\nAnd in my opinion, you're bumbling about blindly making up entities\nwhere there aren't any, and depriving yourself of a true understanding\nand enjoyment of your life.

EDT\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  For everyone listening on KDKA Radio, I'm Mike \nWhitely, KDKA Radio News.  We're here at the Pittsburgh \nInternational Airport and with me is the President of the United \nStates Bill Clinton.\n\t     \n\t     And I'd like to welcome you to the area and to KDKA.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Glad to be here.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There are a lot of things we'd like to talk \nabout in the brief amount of time we have, but some news is just \nbreaking from Los Angeles.  I guess the entire country has been \nkind of holding their breath, wondering what's going to happen in \nthe trial of the four Los Angeles police officers.  We just heard \nthat two of those officers, the sergeant, Sergeant Koon and \nOfficer Powell have been found guilty, and two officers have been \nfound not guilty.\n\t     \n\t     It's a situation that's been building for over a \nyear since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict.  \nAnd I wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see \nthe situation in Los Angeles in connection with your \nadministration and what you're trying to do.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I think the \nAmerican people should know that this trial, in my judgment, is a \ntribute to the work and judgment of the jury, as well as to the \nefforts of the federal government in developing the case.\n\t     \n\t     The law under which the officers were tried is a \ncomplex one; the standards of proof are complicated.  The jury \ndecided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible \nfor supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did \nmost of the beating.  The jury acquitted an officer who kicked \nRodney King, but also plainly tried to shield him from some \nblows, and another officer who was a rookie.\n\t     \n\t     No one knows exactly why they did what they did, but \nit appears that they really tried to do justice here.  They \nacknowledged that his civil rights were violated.  And I think \nthat the American people should take a lot of pride in that.  But \nI hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things:  \nfirst of all, the importance of trying to bring this country \ntogether and not violate the civil rights of any American; \nsecondly, the importance of renewing our fight against crime.  \n\t     \n\t     I think it's important to recognize that in the \npoorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this \ncountry, people may be worried about police abuse, but they're \neven more worried about crime.  It's time that we renewed our \nefforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police \nofficers on the street; pass the Brady Bill that would require a \nwaiting period before people could buy a handgun, and do some \nother things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to \nviolence and drugs.\n\t     \n\t     And the last point I'd like to make is it seems to \nme that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic \nrevitalization of our cities and other economically-distressed \nareas.  If you just think about it -- if everybody in Los Angeles \nwho wanted a job had one, I don't think we'd have quite as many \nproblems as we do.  \n\t     \n\t     And I laid out a very ambitious program in the \ncampaign to try to bring private investment and public investment \nto bear in our cities.  I have dispatched the Commerce Secretary, \nRon Brown, to California to try to come up with some strategies \nfor that state, because it's our biggest state with our highest \nunemployment rate -- which could then be applied around the \ncountry.  I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General, to \nthe new head of the NAACP, to Reverend Jackson, and to several \nother people, and then I'll decide where to go from here with \nregard to Los Angeles and the other cities of the country.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Let's talk about what brings you to the \nPittsburgh area today.  There have been -- I guess there's been a \nlot of discussion on Capitol Hill about your stimulus package.  \nYou've been locked in a battle with the GOP.  Yesterday, as you \nsaid earlier in your radio address, you made some moves to break \nthat gridlock.  What brings you to Pittsburgh, in particular to \nAllegheny County, in particular to Pennsylvania, with that \nbattle?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there are two reasons.  First \nof all, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported \nme in the last election because they wanted a new direction in \neconomic policy.  We have passed our overall economic plan; it \ngives the country a very different budget for the next five years \nthan we've had in the previous 12.  We reduced the deficit and, \nat the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and \nhealth care, in the things that will make us a stronger country.\n\t     \n\t     But in addition to that, I asked the Congress in the \nshort run to spend a little more money, a modest amount of money \nto create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half; \nto try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also \nto try to spark job creation in the private sector more.  The \nplan passed the House.  It has the support of a majority of the \nSenate.  At the present time, all the Republican   senators as a \nbloc are filibustering the bill.  That is, they won't let it come \nto a vote.\n\t     \n\t     I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote \nfor the bill.  And I believe that Senator Dole, the Republican \nleader, has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to \nstay hitched.  And they're all saying that this bill increases \nthe deficit.  It doesn't.  This bill is well below the spending \ntargets that Congress approved, including the Republicans, for \nthis year.  This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five \nyears.  This bill is designed to give a jump-start to the \neconomy.  And I must say, a lot of the Republican senators that \nare holding it up, when Mr. Bush was President, voted for \nbillions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind --\nmuch of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs.\n\t     \n\t     So what I'm trying to do is to break this logjam.  \nI've held out an olive branch, I've offered a compromise.  But I \nthink that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work \nright now to show that we're changing the direction of the \ncountry.  And that's the purpose of the bill.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or \nhis office lately?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we've been trying to talk \nregularly to -- through my White House Congressional Liaison \noperation to the senators that we think are open to this --\nSenator Specter, Senator D'Amato from New York, Senator Jeffords \nfrom Vermont, Senator Hatfield from Oregon, and five or six \nothers whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and \nknow that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life \nof the budget I presented.\n\t     \n\t     You know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've \ngot a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more.  But the truth \nis that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life \nof the budget over the next few years.  And more importantly, we \nhave this program well below the spending targets that Congress \nhas already approved for this year.  And they've done this for \nyears, with the Republicans voting for it -- many Republicans \nvoting for it -- for things that weren't nearly as important as \nputting the American people back to work.  \n\t     \n\t     So I just hope that this doesn't become a political \nissue.  It ought to just be about the people of this country and \nthe need for jobs.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I have some questions from people who supported \nyou, and some people who are skeptical about your administration.  \nIt has to do with their hopes, and also with their fears.  A lot \nof people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania --I \nthink some of them are now saying, we're glad we got him in the \nWhite House, but now look at this incredible process he has to go \nthrough.  Look at these problems.  Look at this gridlock.  And \nthey're beginning to wonder, is this going to work; can you pull \nit off?  And, of course, your skeptics are saying, well, I knew \nit was going to be like this.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I would -- I'd ask \npeople, first of all, to remember that we are, frankly, moving \nvery fast.  The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the \nfastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in \nhistory, setting out the next five-year budget targets.  So we \nare moving really rapidly.  And we've got them working on \npolitical reform, welfare reform, health care reform, a whole \nwide range of things.  \n\t     \n\t     But it's a big operation.  You can't expect to turn \nit around overnight.  It took 12 years to produce the conditions \nwhich led to the victory I received from the people in November, \nand we can't turn it around in 90 days.  But I think we're making \nreal, real progress.  \n\t     \n\t     I would urge the people not to get discouraged.  \nWe're not going to win every battle, and not everything is going \nto happen overnight.  But we are definitely moving and changing \nthings.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Thank you very much.  \n\t     \n\t     The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, \nhere live at Pittsburgh International Airport.

But apart from that little \n:conundrum...\n> \n\tWithout having a complete answer to this question,  I should think\nit obvious that the first step should be to convince people this would be\na desirable result.  There are still quite a lot of people who feel that\nthe command economies of eastern Europe failed due to corruption rather than\nessential weaknesses of caommand economies,  and you still have a majority\nin this nation that favors keeping unenforced and unenforcible laws on\nthe books in order to \"send a signal\".\n\n\n:It would seem that a society with a \"failed\" government would be an ideal\n:setting for libertarian ideals to be implemented.  Now why do you suppose\n:that never seems to occur?...\n\n\nI fail to see why you should feel this way in the first place.  Constant\ncombat isn't particularly conducive to intellectual theorizing.  Also,\nthey tend to get invaded before they can come to anything like a stable\nsociety anyway. \n\n\n>>...\"regulation\" is such a vauge word...  \n> \n:I wouldn't call it \"vague.\"  I'd call it elastic.  All \"regulation\" is \n:not necessarily the same.  By opposing all government regulation, some \n:libertarians treat every system from a command economy to those that\n:regulate relatively free markets as identical.  That's one reason\n:many of the rest of us find their analysis to be simplistic. \n> \n\nUmm, is there any distinction between \"vague\" and \"elastic\" in this\ncontext aside from one having a more positive connotation than the other?\n\nAt any rate,  we've been through all this before.\n\n:Steve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM   \n:\"One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh\n: the bulls**t.\" - R.

Therefore there will be\nno Artemis or 20 million dollar lunar orbiter et cetera...\n\nThey were killing Griffin's main program simply because some sycophants\nsomewhere had Congress beleivin that to do so would simply be to buy into\nthe same old stuff. Sorta like not giving aid to Yeltsin because he's\na communist hardliner.\n\nAt least now the sort of reforms Griffin was trying to bring forward\nwon't be trapped in their own little easily contained and defunded\nghetto. That Griffin is staying in some capacity is very very very\ngood.

Isn't it love your enemies instead?  They may say they are \"Christian\"\nbut do their actions speak differently?  Do you believe what everyone tells\nyou?  I don't.  I came to believe in God by my own investigation and conclusions.\nAnd ultimately by my own choice.  Salvation, however, was granted only through\nthe grace of God.\n\n|> The Bible provides us with no clear definition of what a Christian is.

Believing in Christ and having your sins\nforgiven in His name does NOT give a Christian a free licence to sin.  To\nrepent of a sin is to ask forgiveness of that sin and TRY NOT to do it\nagain.  I am a Christian, but if you lump me in with racists and accuse me\nof being such, then are you not pre-judging me?  BTW, I am of Chinese racial\nbackground and I know what it is to be part of a visible minority in this\ncountry.  I don't think that I would be favourably looked upon by these\nWhite supremist \"Christians\" as you call them.\n\nAnyone can say what they believe, but if they don't practice what they preach,\nthen their belief is false.  Do you concur?\n \n|> Now, for your original statement:\n|> : |> : What bothers me most is why people who have no religious affiliation \n|> : |> : continue to persecute Jews?

They can do as they do and hide behind Christianity\nbut I tell you that Jesus would have nothing to do with them.\n\n|> About the only one that\n|> comes to mind would be in the former Soviet Union, where many religious\n|> people suffered some sort of persecution (not to mention many\n|> atheist/agnostics who suffered persecution for believing the government\n|> sucked).\n|> \n\nNo arguement there.\n\n|>\n|> Rob Lanphier\n|> lanph872@uidaho.edu\n|> \n\nThe only point I'm trying to make is that those who call themselves Christian\nmay not be Christian.
