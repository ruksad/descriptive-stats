        "In the real world, data rarely comes with clean labels. As a machine learning engineer at a data-centric company, you’re handed fairly large, unlabelled datasets across two domains—images and text. Your team is tasked with building a functional classification system, but without labeled training data, the first challenge is to create your own labels. Welcome to your mission: learning to label intelligently and building robust classifiers from scratch."

EDT\\n\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that \\nOctavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today \\nabout why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to \\nget a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature \\nof learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of \\npeople like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of \\nthose who are here.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education \\nand all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my \\ngood friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and \\nall of the business and local community leaders from the city and \\ncounty and state level from around America who are here. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved \\nhearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is \\ntheir future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A \\nyear and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because \\nI was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our \\ncountry, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had \\ntoo little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines \\nof income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to \\ntake us into the future.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I entered with the hope that together we could create \\nmore opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of \\nour people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of \\nAmerica's community, knowing that together we could always to more \\nthan we could individually and that we might secure our future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 \\njobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the \\ncommitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, \\nand those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs \\ndoes, and the successes of all the young people like those on this \\nstage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all \\nthose things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're \\non the right track.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Last July when I was traveling across America's \\nheartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in \\nLouisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business \\npeople who were participating in the Louisville Education and \\nEmployment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  \\nI saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed \\nboth in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my \\nown state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about \\n-- that for millions of American young people it is really an \\nimpediment to both their learning and their ability to be good \\nworkers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what \\nis learning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     In the world in which we are living, the average young \\nperson will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a \\nlifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning \\nworld much better.  And we must determine that all of our young \\npeople see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased \\nhere today.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Whether you're in business or in government or in \\neducation, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to \\nbuilding a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all \\nof our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things \\nare pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best \\nthing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have \\njobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty \\ngood education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that \\nthey'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either \\npolitical or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great \\nchallenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to \\nfully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work \\nfor them to do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     All the European countries have higher unemployment \\nrates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the \\nunemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  \\nThey're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its \\nmost rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that \\nI have proposed to create jobs. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now \\nabout as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  \\nIt costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of \\npressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing \\ntheir own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their \\npeople.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But it is especially important for America for two \\nreasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move \\naggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be \\ncompetitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, \\neven if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed \\nof the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to \\nwork in this country.  (Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some \\nof it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and \\nmoving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We \\nhave now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big \\norganizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they \\nare organized and who ask whether there are too many people working \\nat some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to \\ncreate jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the \\nchance to work.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare \\nreform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of \\nmonths -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the \\nend of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  \\n(Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of \\nthe American people to perform without regard to race or income or \\nthe circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that \\nthere are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their \\ntalent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  \\nI do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if \\nyou want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more \\nresponsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this \\ncountry that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you \\nhave got to have opportunity in that mix. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for \\nevery young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules \\nand work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be \\nsomething at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are \\nbasically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, \\nrecognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of \\nour people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their \\nbackground.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's \\nsomething there for them to do?\\n\\n\\t     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an \\nintegral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of \\nwork and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people \\nfirst, and it does have a partnership between the public and private \\nsector.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in \\nFebruary on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 \\nextra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the \\nAmerican business community to meet that target so that we can create  \\nmore than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been \\ncreated before.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And \\nJerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in \\nthis room and around the country -- people who are going to do more \\nthan they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people \\na work experience.  And it is terribly important.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is \\npart of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the \\nAmerican people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their \\njobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving \\nthe transition from school to work for young people who don't go to \\ncollege but do need at least two years of post-high school training \\neither on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, \\nso that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more \\npeople to go on to college who do want to go.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive \\nplan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The \\nemergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would \\ncreate a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and \\nthat would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It \\nwould also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work \\nforce in jobs that otherwise will not be created.\\n\\t     \\n\\t      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to \\ninvest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --\\nprojects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, \\nnew industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities \\n-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve \\nthe environment.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The summer jobs program is an important part of that \\nbecause we have tried for the first time, through the work of the \\nLabor Department and the Education Department and through reaching \\nout to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer \\njobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to \\nhopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young \\npeople into further educational opportunities and to further job \\nopportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component \\nto these summer jobs -- something that the United States government \\nhas never fully emphasized before.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because \\nthey come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in \\ndifficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building \\ntheir basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other \\nareas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who \\nhave difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what \\nthey learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next \\nyear.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     What we are trying to do here is to give people the \\nopportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning \\nskills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next \\ncouple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school \\nin this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning \\nenvironment.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities \\nfor people to learn and work during the school year, so that this \\nwill not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will \\nbe a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new \\nwork experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-\\nwork jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding \\nthe job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help \\nto build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve \\nlocal problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public \\nbuildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in \\nhospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, \\nand learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while \\nthey earn, but letting them earn.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people \\nwho have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should \\ndo this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the \\nopportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing \\nin going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't \\nexactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare \\nsystem; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people \\nto work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the \\nuse of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if \\nyou're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to \\nreward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  \\n(Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The young people we propose to put to work under our \\nprogram will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, \\nreading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will \\nstretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a \\nsense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, \\nbut a challenge that will take them into a different life.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even \\nas I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the \\nsummer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll \\nsee whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer \\nacademically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved \\nahead.  I suspect that they will.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I \\nwill be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn \\nfrom you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next \\nsummer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school \\nyear, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that \\nwe do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so \\nthat we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private \\ninvestments as well. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the \\nbusiness leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this \\nsummer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business \\nwho have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who \\nhaven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about \\nthis event today, I want to implore other private employers to \\nstretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this \\nsummer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when \\nwe don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort \\nthem to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up \\nhere on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking \\nabout work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've \\ndone to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very \\nfoolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand \\nand sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had \\never had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be \\nworth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     That does not mean young people should not be \\nentrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation \\nahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and \\nworked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  \\nAnd I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some \\npeople say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I \\ngrew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul \\nwithout regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a \\njob.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to \\npeople is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a \\njob and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now \\nI live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any \\nmore money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're \\nworking longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  \\nAnd we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these \\nyoung people want.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  \\nIt doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration \\npursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private \\nsector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn \\nhow to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created \\nin this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done \\noff-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a \\nthird or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do \\neconomically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of \\nAmerica's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just \\nkidding.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy \\ncountry in the world, including the United States, is having \\ndifficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done \\nI'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole \\ndeliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the \\nanswers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  \\n(Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And so the jobs program that I have presented to \\nCongress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the \\ncounties, through the Community Development Program, with the \\ninfrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an \\nattempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the \\neconomy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little \\nboost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a \\nmillion jobs and maybe get the engine going again.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in \\nthe private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government \\nmoney.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American \\neconomy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind \\nof system we have and it works pretty well.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you \\nhere today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends \\nand neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers \\nto make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the \\nfunds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government \\nshould create this summer, so that together we can have this \\npartnership.

I don't\\n>have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:\\n>\\n>[...]  Any stories on how you all learned?\\n\\nI'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.\\n\\nEarly in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on\\nhis old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I\\nactually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.\\n\\nI proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and\\nrode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to\\ninvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then\\nI also passed my road test.\\n\\nOn May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a\\n4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),\\nI had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,\\nskidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the\\noncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was\\nalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under\\na car and been killed.\\n\\nNow this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the\\nExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training\\ncould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater\\nsince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff\\nas I did.\\n\\nSo my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I\\nwouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you\\nhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until\\nyou're ready to use it.\\n\\n>1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have \\n>to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too \\n>ignorant to know I need to buy)\\n\\nWhile you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in\\nDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you\\nsave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,\\nplus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure\\nthe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up\\nmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration\\nand licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not\\nincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.\\n\\n>2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in \\n>about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up\\n>till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a \\n>motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes\\n>a difference)\\n\\nI pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200\\nin Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial\\ncoverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be\\npoor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo\\nmore expensive.\\n\\n>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?\\n\\nThere used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle\\nmagazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or\\nrecent models might be available.  You could probably look through\\npast issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first\\nbike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice\\ninstead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that\\nare parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by\\nnoticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around\\nand they were generally set up the way I wanted.\\n\\nNothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting\\nshowrooms.

Do the gases really \\n>compress that much?\\n\\n    For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses\\nin the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.\\n\\n1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force\\nair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake\\nvalve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only\\nthe difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after\\nthe exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the\\nintake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing\\natmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time\\ndoes the pressure ever become \"negative\", or even approach a good\\nvacuum.\\n\\n2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the\\ncombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up\\nto the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume\\nof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume\\nthat must flow through the intake, because of the temperature\\ndifference and the products of combustion.\\n\\n3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started\\npaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty\\nhorsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,\\nsubstitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost\\nzero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very\\nwell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make\\nvery little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is\\n_much_ louder than the stocker.\\n\\n4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.\\nIf free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference\\nwas noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.\\n\\n5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any\\ngiven RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it\\non the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.\\nPumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n| Dave Tharp                      | DoD #0751   | \"You can\\'t wear out       |\\n| davet@interceptor.CDS.TEK.COM   | MRA #151    |   an Indian Scout,        |\\n| \\'88 K75S  \\'48 Indian Chief      | AHRMA #751  |  Or its brother the Chief.|\\n| \\'75 R90S(#151) \\'72 TR-2B(#751)  | AMA #524737 |  They\\'re built like rocks |\\n| \\'65 R50/2/Velorex  \\'57 NSU Max  |             |   to take the knocks,     |\\n|       1936 BMW R12              | (Compulsive | It\\'s the Harleys that     |\\n| My employer has no idea.        |   Joiner)   |   give you grief.\"        |\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n',\n",

My voice is coming to\\nyou this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio\\nstation in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to\\nmeet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,\\nhealth care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly\\nbroadcast with the American people. \\n             \\n             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when\\nit reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past\\nseven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with\\nthe people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus\\ntour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last\\nyear's campaign.\\n             \\n             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with\\nyou, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and\\nwhat I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting\\nto you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.\\n             \\n             You sent me to Washington to get our government and\\neconomy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad\\nexperiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important\\nit is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do\\nbusiness.  \\n             \\n             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations\\nrise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness\\nof their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the\\ncooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,\\nlabor and government.  Although many of the economies of the\\nindustrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've\\nmade many of the smart investments and the tough choices which\\nour government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them\\nhave been moving ahead and too many of our people have been\\nfalling behind.\\n             \\n             We have an economy today that even when it grows is\\nnot producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation\\nby four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to\\nshow for it.  We know that wages of most working people have\\nstopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks\\nand that too many families can no longer afford the escalating\\ncost of health care.\\n             \\n             But we also know that, given the right tools, the\\nright incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and\\nbusinesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy\\nneeds to expand opportunity and to make our communities better\\nplaces to live.\\n             \\n             In many critical products today Americans are the\\nlow cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that\\nwe create more of those kinds of jobs.\\n             \\n             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for\\nlong-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old\\npriorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to\\nbe -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs\\nand education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the\\nwaste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious\\nresources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the\\ngroundwork for robust economic growth in the future.\\n             \\n             These new directions passed the Congress in record\\ntime and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our\\ncountry.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would\\ncreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private\\nsector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It\\nnow has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. \\nBut it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the\\nSenate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know\\nwould result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.\\n             \\n             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. \\nMillions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and\\ncounting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill\\nhas been grounded by gridlock.  \\n             \\n             I know the American people are tired of business as\\nusual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin\\nor wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have\\ntaken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra\\nmile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25\\npercent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  \\n             \\n             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million\\nAmericans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill\\nlanguish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean\\nhundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to\\nact to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking\\nthis initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I\\nthink we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant\\nportion of our original goals.\\n             \\n             First, we want to keep the programs as much as\\npossible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,\\nincluding highway and road construction, summer jobs for young\\npeople, immunization for children, construction of waste water\\nsites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding\\nfor extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who\\nhave been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't\\ncreating jobs.\\n             \\n             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs\\nin the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40\\npercent.\\n             \\n             And third, I've recommended a new element in this\\nprogram to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against\\ncrime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire\\npolice officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put\\nthem back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight\\nfor a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it\\nand deserve it.\\n             \\n             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --\\nthe Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it\\nincreases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this\\nyear that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,\\ndoesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more\\nthan paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this\\nbudget is well within the spending limits already approved by the\\nCongress this year.\\n             \\n             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators\\nwho are filibustering the bill voted during the previous\\nadministration for billions of dollars of the same kind of\\nemergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the\\nAmerican people to work.  \\n             \\n             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered\\na plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities\\nare -- on people or on politics.  \\n             \\n             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar\\nfor dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the\\nsoundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our\\nchildren.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs\\nand investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of\\nus when we've helped make more American partners working to\\nensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.\\n             \\n             You know, if every American who wanted a job had\\none, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this\\ncountry today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first\\nstep to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country\\nagain.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid\\nfor over the life of our budget.\\n             \\n             Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how\\nimportant the bill is.

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design\\n    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.\\n\\n\\n    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into\\n    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20\\n    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas\\n    scintillation proportional counters.\\n\\n\\n    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint\\n    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.\\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\\'s atmosphere,\\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\\'s\\n    satellites, and characterize Titan\\'s atmosphere and surface.\\n\\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\\n    peer through Titan\\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\\n\\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\\n    Saturn\\'s satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan\\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan\\n    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true\\n    nature of Saturn\\'s rings.\\n\\n\\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)\\n\\t -------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch\\n\\t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist\\n\\t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival\\n\\t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release\\n\\t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry\\n\\t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission\\n\\t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)\\n\\n\\n    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit.

The satellite also\\n    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.\\n\\n\\n    ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over\\n    its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields\\n    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for\\n    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.\\n\\n    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of\\n    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from\\n    that planet by sliding over Jupiter\\'s north pole in a gravity-assist\\n    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun\\'s south pole\\n    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its\\n    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that\\'s right, a solar-studies spacecraft\\n    that\\'s always further from the Sun than the Earth is!\\n\\n    While in Jupiter\\'s neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and\\n    radiation environment.

Hiermee ontstond de tweede\\nuniversiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste\\nwaarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde\\nin de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de\\nvoorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350\\njaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.\\n\\nDe huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten\\nsterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht,\\nvieren de benoeming van hun \\'oervader\\' middels een breed scala\\naan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een\\nplanetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal\\nvoordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies\\nNatalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er\\nstaat echter meer op stapel.\\n\\nStudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een\\nsterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het\\nsymposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het\\nhuidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten\\n\\'compacte objecten\\', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren.\\nBij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de\\ndeelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van\\nde stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de\\neerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een\\nbeknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren,\\nwaarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een\\nhalf uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten\\nzullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot\\nhet stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op\\neen apart vel.\\nHet niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars\\nstudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN\\nZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!\\n\\nTijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed\\ngaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht\\nWesterbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen\\nhet heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van\\neen snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar,\\nin de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren.\\nProf. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel\\nopvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en\\ntrachten te verklaren.\\nHet slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de\\ntechnische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn\\nnamelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10\\nmiljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30\\nWatt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal\\ner niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse\\ntechnologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.\\n\\nDeelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en\\nf 16,- (inclusief lunch).

              " '\\nMy previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or\\nsomething. I\\'ve weathered attempted dog attacks before using the\\napproved method: Slow down to screw up dog\\'s triangulation of target,\\nthen take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it\\ndidn\\'t work because I didn\\'t have time. Riding up the hill leading to my\\nhouse, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to\\nthe Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to\\nthe Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to\\nharm.\\n\\nBut I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the\\nroughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph\\nfor the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the\\nleft side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he\\nhad been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away,\\nheading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I\\nsaw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took\\nthe dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was\\ndriven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent\\nmarks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think\\nI saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this\\nmoment is hazy.\\n\\nI next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The\\napologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut\\nmouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my\\nshin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not.\\nSo I\\'m left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!\\n\\nInterestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never\\nmoved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike\\noff course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some\\ngut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me\\nhere, as I didn\\'t feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.\\n\\nWhat worries me about the accident is this: I don\\'t think I could have\\nprevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not\\nnecessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was\\nriding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if\\nit had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the\\nthought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a\\nblind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are\\nlong enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?\\n\\nI eagerly await comment.\\n\\nRyan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\\nKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\\nDoD# 0863      |I\\'d be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\\n\\n\\n * SLMR 2.1a * \"He\\'s hurt.\" \"Dammit Jim, I\\'m a Doctor -- oh, right.\"\\n                                                                                       \\n----\\n+===============================================================+\\n|COMPUTER DYNAMICS BBS    604-255-9937(HST)    604-986-9937(V32)|\\n|Vancouver, BC, Canada -  Easy Access, Low Rates, Friendly Sysop|\\n+===============================================================+\\n',\n",

It is the \"L\" word -\\nLOSER !!\\n\\n\\tThat\\'s right. When we boil all the crap out of this argument, it\\nis all about WINNING and LOSING, and nothing else. Let me explain.\\n\\n\\tRemember the eighties ? No excuses. Nobody who can handle a mail\\nbuffer can claim they are \"too young\" to remember Ronald Reagan - yet.\\nThe eighties were about \"How America Learned to Win Once Again\". Then\\n(wouldn\\'t you know), we won so well that there was nothing left to win.\\nNo Cold War to endure. No nuclear holocaust. No more worlds to conquer\\n(We forgot about outer space long ago). The kind of overwhelming, no\\nholds barred success that killed Alexander the Great. Yes, there were a\\nfew \"little\" problems along the way - stock market meltdown here, an\\nS&L bailout there, a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators to\\ncontend with, but as Tacitus would tell ya\\', the God Augustus never had\\nit so good. \\n\\n\\tIn the meantime, there is guilt for winning, maybe a fear that one\\ndoesn\\'t deserve one\\'s bounty - or success. So there is a \"kinder and gentler\\ntype of politician these days, Bill Clinton, affirmative action, and lots of\\ndiscourse about people who \"don\\'t get it\". For those of us in the winning\\nbusiness, this kind of talk is mildly irritating, but there is still no \\nsuggestion of losing.\\n\\n\\tBut what do we find now ? To put it mildy, the stereotype of our \\n\"white male\" non-winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl, punching out \\nphotojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another one\\nwith a \"Hail Mary\" pass in the Fourth Quarter. (The whole idea behind \\'three\\nyards and a cloud of dust\\' is to wear your opponent down until he collapses\\nin the final period) But Woody just used his fists - Uzzies seem to be the \\nweapon of choice these days. \\n\\t\\n\\tWho is D-FENS, anyway ? The answer is as plain as the horn rims on \\nyour face. The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS, posing as a LOSER. This \\nis known as controversial casting. But that baggy short-sleeved white shirt \\nsure does look natural on Mike doesn\\'t it. Gordon Gekko will never look the \\nsame. (Though Woody always dressed that way.) Did we really expect Gekko to \\ntake it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ?\\n\\n\\tWhat we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing D-FENS is \\nthe same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood\\nused to blow away all the time. As that arch-WASP (male gender) George C. Scott\\ndeclaimed, \"Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN. They love a winner, and will \\nnot tolerate a loser.\" And so on. \\n\\n\\tThe political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - and\\nDemocrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some \\n\"equitable\" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a \\nloser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asian\\nhomosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined\\nday when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%) \\nminority.\\n\\n\\tOr you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do most\\nconservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn\\'t care\\nwho\\'s winning and who\\'s losing. In some cases, you might say something\\nabout make sure the game is fair (equality of opportunity, not of condition).\\nIn the latter case, you might be able to identify yourself as a \\n\"neoconservative\" or a \"neoliberal\" depending on how much you want to limit\\nthe pot.\\n\\n\\tEither way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be\\npopular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you\\'ll still\\nbe popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I \\nwould imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it\\nis the only way to go. (Even in Hollywood, which treats Losers worse than any\\nother place in America except for New York and Washington, D.C. - and even in\\nColumbus, Ohio, which produced Alex Keaton, but no champion football teams in\\nthe eighties and the first quarter of the nineties) I\\'d like to \\nsee more Winners in this society, regardless of race, gender, religious \\npreference, and sexual orientation.

The noise you hear is due to the momentary\\nopening and closing of the path.\\n\\nThe noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high\\nimpedance audio circuits a resistive \"T\" is constructed close to characteristic\\nimpedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers\\nthe audio.\\n\\nIn low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are\\nshorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic\\nimpedance.\\n\\nSometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used\\nto momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.\\n\\nTelephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to \"Make before\\nbreak and Vica Versa\" but I haven\\'t seen any of these for years.\\n\\nNowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.\\n\\nA novel circuit I used to build was a primitive \"optical isolator\".. It consists\\nof a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is\\noff the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers\\npassing the audio.  Once again this device in a \"T\" switches the audio.  Varying\\nthe lamp resistance give a remote volume control.

              " '\\n   Two developments have brought these type of activities back to\\nthe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a\\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this \"Banner\" reflector was blank,\\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the \"Environmental\\nBillboard\".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the \"Environmental\\nBillboard\" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\\ndeployed by the inflatable \\'frame\\'.\\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry \"ozone reading\\nsensors\" to \"continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\\'s\\ndelicate protective ozone layer,\" according to Mike Lawson, head of\\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\\'s\\natmosphere. According to IMI, \"as the biodegradable material burns,\\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\\nreplenish the ozone layer.\" The remaining spacecraft will monitor\\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\\nup and \"adds to the ozone supply.\"\\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \\'unit\\' cost\\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\\n  \\nBut back to Brian\\'s questions:\\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the \"wild\\n>idea\" stage or does it have real funding?\\n  \\n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\\'t piggy back upon\\nsomeone else\\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\\nlaunch.  That\\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\\'t think the\\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\\nand no, I don\\'t really like the idea of this additional light\\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\\nidiot?)\\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\\'s in a low\\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\\'s the time\\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\\'t heard of any serious funding\\nfor this, but I\\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking\\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\\n  \\n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\\nmy guest.

However you asked something a \\nlittle differently this time, you asked for an objective basis for a\\nnotion. The fact that the use of science as an intellectual tool is\\nresponsible for changes in our world (the changes are material, and\\nthus \"objective\") would provide an objective _basis_ for an argument.\\nHowever, the conclusion arrived at from that argument (that science is \\n\"good\") is subjective.\\n\\nI think that the problem here is one of word usage.

              " '\\n\\nThe following is an introduction as to who is Muhammad SAW\\nas will be covered with this treatise.\\n\\nMUHAMMAD peace and blessings of Allah be upon him (SAW)\\nis the last prophet of Islam.  He is the Prophet who is revealed\\nthe last Holy Scripture, Qur\\'an, by Allah SWA (all praise be to Him)\\nthrough the Arch Angel Gabriel.  He is the seal of all prophets\\ntill the day of judgement as stated in the Qur\\'an by Allah\\nSWA (all praise be to Him).  Muhammad SAW lived between\\n571-632 AC.  All other prophethoods claimed after Muhammad SAW,\\nis a treason against Islam, against Qur\\'an, against the message\\nof Allah SWA.  Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael, another\\nmessenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah.\\nHe is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his\\ncoming.  The above mentioned verse from the Qur\\'an is from \\nChapter 33, Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:\\n\\n\\tMuhammad is not the father of any of your men,\\n\\tbut (he is) the messenger of Allah, and the seal\\n\\tof the prophets, and Allah has full knowledge of\\n\\tall things.\\n\\n---------------------\\nCommentary on the above verse:  When a document is sealed,\\nit is complete, and there can be no further addition.  The \\nHoly Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers.\\nAllah\\'s teaching is and will always be continuous, but there\\nhas been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW.  The later\\nages will want thinkers, and revivers, not Prophets.  This is not\\nan arbitrary matter.  It is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom,\\n\"for Allah has full knowledge of all things.\"\\n\\n----------------------\\nDROPLET VOL 1, No 11, Part 2\\n\\nA   D R O P L E T\\nFrom The Vast Ocean Of The Miraculous Qur\\'an\\n\\nTranslations from the Arabic and Turkish Writings of \\nBediuzzaman Said Nursi, The Risale-i Noor\\n\\nVOL 1, No 11, Part 2\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n   \\t\\t NINETEENTH LETTER  \\n\\n\\t\\t MU\\'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI \\n(A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW)       \\n\\n(continued from Droplet Vol 1, No 11, Part 1)\\n\\n   SECOND  SIGN:   The  Noble  Messenger  (SAW)\\ndeclared His prophethood, and presented to humanity a\\ndecree as the Glorious Qur\\'an and manifest miracles\\nwhich number, according to the scholars, one thousand.\\nThe occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as\\ncertain as the fact that He declared himself prophet.  In\\nfact, as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate\\nunbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise\\nOur\\'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of His\\nmiracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(Allah forbids) \\nsorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their\\nfollowers.  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW) have the\\ncertainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema (scholars\\nof Islam) to the hundreth degree.\\n   The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of\\nthe universe of His declaration of Prophethood; it has the\\neffect of the words,\\'You have indeed spoken the truth !\\'\\n   Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler,\\nwhile being observed by Him, \\'The true ruler has\\nappointed me to such and such position.  \\'At a time when\\nyou were asked to prove your claim, the word \\'Yes\\'\\nuttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you.  Or, if\\nthe ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your\\nrequest, this would confirm your claim even more soundly\\nand more definitely than would the word \\'Yes.\\'\\n   In the same way, ALLAH\\'s Most Noble Messenger\\nclaimed: \\'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this\\nuniverse.  My proof is that He will change His unbroken\\norder at my request and my prayer.  Now look at my\\nfingers:  He makes them run like a fountain with five\\nspigots.  Look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, He\\nsplits it in two.  Look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear\\nwitness to me, it moves and comes near to me.  Look at\\nthis food: although it is barely enough for two or three\\nmen, it satisfies two or three hundred.  \\'Further he shows\\nhundreds of similar miracles.  However, the evidences  of\\nthe veracity of this high being and the proofs of his\\nprophethood are not restricted to his miracles.  All his\\ndeeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral\\nconduct and manners, his character and appearance\\nprove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness.\\nIndeed, many people  such  as  Abdullah  b. Salam,  the\\nfamous scholar of the Children of Israel, came to belief\\nmerely by seeing him, and said, \\'No lie can hide in this\\nface, nor can any fraud be found in it!\\'\\n   Although many of the  researchers have concluded\\nthat the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his\\nmiracles number about one thousand, there are\\nthousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of\\nhis prophethood.  And hundreds of thousands of\\ntruth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions\\nhave affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of\\nways.\\n   The Wise Our\\'an alone demonstrates thousands of\\nthe proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty\\naspects of miraculousness.  Since prophethood is as a\\nphenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of\\nindividuals who claimed prophethood and performed\\nmiracles have lived and passed away; then, the\\nprophethood of Muhammad (SAW) is of a certanity\\nsuperior to that of the prophethood of all the others.  For\\nwhatever evidences, qualities  and attributes  became the\\nmeans of the prophethood and messengership of all the\\nmessengers such as Jesus (AS) and Moses (AS), they\\nare all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive\\nfashion by Muhammad (SAW).  And since the causes and\\nmeans of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the\\nperson of Muhammad (SAW), this authority is to be found\\nin him with more certanity than all the other prophets.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\\nTo be Continued Allah Willing.\\nIrfan Alan, A Servant of Islam.\\n\\n',\n",

However the context identifies it as another\\nfalse [or at least theologically unsound] statement.\\n\\n5) By the way, I enjoy science.\\n\\nOn the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science\\nto enjoy science in any meaningful sense.

They did not know, or were not\\nsure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the \\ncompound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were\\nsupposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.\\n\\nI spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR\\n(Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.

It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in,\\ntherefore the theoretical height for a constant section column\\nthat can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft,\\nor 75 Statute miles.\\n\\nNow, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss\\ntype, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength.\\nLet us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical \\nstrength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant\\nsection column.  \\n\\nA constant section column is not the limit on how high you can\\nbuild something if you allow a tapering of the cross section\\nas you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound\\nload to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in\\ncalculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross\\nsectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure\\nbelow the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile \\nbelow the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.\\n\\nThe next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section\\nto support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile\\nof structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way\\nto the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical\\nlimit on area, although there will be practical limits based\\non how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how\\nmuch load you need to support on the ground (for which you need\\na foundation that the bedrock can support.\\n\\nLet us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction\\ncost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites,\\nassuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure\\nis just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass\\nratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower\\nheight becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant\\natmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still\\nhave to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses\\nwill be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of\\nrocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,\\nbut which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus\\nthey represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting\\nfrom the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.\\n\\nThis analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind\\nloads.  These will require more structural support over the first\\n15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low\\nenough value for it not to be a big factor.\\n\\nDani Eder\\n\\n-- \\nDani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/\\nRt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.\\n\",\n",

EDT\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  For everyone listening on KDKA Radio, I'm Mike \\nWhitely, KDKA Radio News.  We're here at the Pittsburgh \\nInternational Airport and with me is the President of the United \\nStates Bill Clinton.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I'd like to welcome you to the area and to KDKA.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Glad to be here.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There are a lot of things we'd like to talk \\nabout in the brief amount of time we have, but some news is just \\nbreaking from Los Angeles.  I guess the entire country has been \\nkind of holding their breath, wondering what's going to happen in \\nthe trial of the four Los Angeles police officers.  We just heard \\nthat two of those officers, the sergeant, Sergeant Koon and \\nOfficer Powell have been found guilty, and two officers have been \\nfound not guilty.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     It's a situation that's been building for over a \\nyear since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict.  \\nAnd I wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see \\nthe situation in Los Angeles in connection with your \\nadministration and what you're trying to do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I think the \\nAmerican people should know that this trial, in my judgment, is a \\ntribute to the work and judgment of the jury, as well as to the \\nefforts of the federal government in developing the case.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The law under which the officers were tried is a \\ncomplex one; the standards of proof are complicated.  The jury \\ndecided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible \\nfor supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did \\nmost of the beating.  The jury acquitted an officer who kicked \\nRodney King, but also plainly tried to shield him from some \\nblows, and another officer who was a rookie.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     No one knows exactly why they did what they did, but \\nit appears that they really tried to do justice here.  They \\nacknowledged that his civil rights were violated.  And I think \\nthat the American people should take a lot of pride in that.  But \\nI hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things:  \\nfirst of all, the importance of trying to bring this country \\ntogether and not violate the civil rights of any American; \\nsecondly, the importance of renewing our fight against crime.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think it's important to recognize that in the \\npoorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this \\ncountry, people may be worried about police abuse, but they're \\neven more worried about crime.  It's time that we renewed our \\nefforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police \\nofficers on the street; pass the Brady Bill that would require a \\nwaiting period before people could buy a handgun, and do some \\nother things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to \\nviolence and drugs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And the last point I'd like to make is it seems to \\nme that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic \\nrevitalization of our cities and other economically-distressed \\nareas.  If you just think about it -- if everybody in Los Angeles \\nwho wanted a job had one, I don't think we'd have quite as many \\nproblems as we do.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I laid out a very ambitious program in the \\ncampaign to try to bring private investment and public investment \\nto bear in our cities.  I have dispatched the Commerce Secretary, \\nRon Brown, to California to try to come up with some strategies \\nfor that state, because it's our biggest state with our highest \\nunemployment rate -- which could then be applied around the \\ncountry.  I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General, to \\nthe new head of the NAACP, to Reverend Jackson, and to several \\nother people, and then I'll decide where to go from here with \\nregard to Los Angeles and the other cities of the country.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Let's talk about what brings you to the \\nPittsburgh area today.  There have been -- I guess there's been a \\nlot of discussion on Capitol Hill about your stimulus package.  \\nYou've been locked in a battle with the GOP.  Yesterday, as you \\nsaid earlier in your radio address, you made some moves to break \\nthat gridlock.  What brings you to Pittsburgh, in particular to \\nAllegheny County, in particular to Pennsylvania, with that \\nbattle?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there are two reasons.  First \\nof all, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported \\nme in the last election because they wanted a new direction in \\neconomic policy.  We have passed our overall economic plan; it \\ngives the country a very different budget for the next five years \\nthan we've had in the previous 12.  We reduced the deficit and, \\nat the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and \\nhealth care, in the things that will make us a stronger country.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But in addition to that, I asked the Congress in the \\nshort run to spend a little more money, a modest amount of money \\nto create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half; \\nto try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also \\nto try to spark job creation in the private sector more.  The \\nplan passed the House.  It has the support of a majority of the \\nSenate.  At the present time, all the Republican   senators as a \\nbloc are filibustering the bill.  That is, they won't let it come \\nto a vote.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote \\nfor the bill.  And I believe that Senator Dole, the Republican \\nleader, has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to \\nstay hitched.  And they're all saying that this bill increases \\nthe deficit.  It doesn't.  This bill is well below the spending \\ntargets that Congress approved, including the Republicans, for \\nthis year.  This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five \\nyears.  This bill is designed to give a jump-start to the \\neconomy.  And I must say, a lot of the Republican senators that \\nare holding it up, when Mr. Bush was President, voted for \\nbillions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind --\\nmuch of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So what I'm trying to do is to break this logjam.  \\nI've held out an olive branch, I've offered a compromise.  But I \\nthink that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work \\nright now to show that we're changing the direction of the \\ncountry.  And that's the purpose of the bill.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or \\nhis office lately?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we've been trying to talk \\nregularly to -- through my White House Congressional Liaison \\noperation to the senators that we think are open to this --\\nSenator Specter, Senator D'Amato from New York, Senator Jeffords \\nfrom Vermont, Senator Hatfield from Oregon, and five or six \\nothers whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and \\nknow that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life \\nof the budget I presented.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've \\ngot a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more.  But the truth \\nis that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life \\nof the budget over the next few years.  And more importantly, we \\nhave this program well below the spending targets that Congress \\nhas already approved for this year.  And they've done this for \\nyears, with the Republicans voting for it -- many Republicans \\nvoting for it -- for things that weren't nearly as important as \\nputting the American people back to work.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I just hope that this doesn't become a political \\nissue.  It ought to just be about the people of this country and \\nthe need for jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I have some questions from people who supported \\nyou, and some people who are skeptical about your administration.  \\nIt has to do with their hopes, and also with their fears.  A lot \\nof people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania --I \\nthink some of them are now saying, we're glad we got him in the \\nWhite House, but now look at this incredible process he has to go \\nthrough.  Look at these problems.  Look at this gridlock.  And \\nthey're beginning to wonder, is this going to work; can you pull \\nit off?  And, of course, your skeptics are saying, well, I knew \\nit was going to be like this.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I would -- I'd ask \\npeople, first of all, to remember that we are, frankly, moving \\nvery fast.  The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the \\nfastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in \\nhistory, setting out the next five-year budget targets.  So we \\nare moving really rapidly.  And we've got them working on \\npolitical reform, welfare reform, health care reform, a whole \\nwide range of things.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But it's a big operation.  You can't expect to turn \\nit around overnight.  It took 12 years to produce the conditions \\nwhich led to the victory I received from the people in November, \\nand we can't turn it around in 90 days.  But I think we're making \\nreal, real progress.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I would urge the people not to get discouraged.  \\nWe're not going to win every battle, and not everything is going \\nto happen overnight.  But we are definitely moving and changing \\nthings.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Thank you very much.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, \\nhere live at Pittsburgh International Airport.  I'm Mike Whitely, \\nKDKA News.\\n\\n                               END10:31 A.M. EDT\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

              " '\\n\\nThere has been a lot of discussion about Tyre.  In sum, Ezekiel prophesied\\nthat the place would be mashed and never rebuilt; as there are a lot of\\npeople living there, it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct.\\n\\nThis doesn\\'t bother me at all, because I understand the language Ezekiel used\\ndifferently than do so-called Biblical literalists.  For example, it sometimes\\nhappens that someone says \"My grandson is the cutest baby!\" and then turns\\naround and sees the granddaughter and says \"Oh!  Isn\\'t she the cutest thing!?\"\\n\\nThis person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the\\nworld according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for\\nfirst.  Rather, he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very\\nobject-oriented.  Because this example is one that is common to many people,\\nnobody misunderstands the intent of the statements; the Bible, however, is\\noften at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly\\nliterally true.  For those people, the existence of Tyre is a problem; for me,\\nit is not.\\n\\n\\nTurning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel, we read this from\\nJohn E King:\\n\\n> The prophesy clearly implies that people would still be living in the\\n> area[.]\\n\\nNo, it implies nothing of the kind.  If you had nothing but the prophecy from\\nEzekiel, and you were told you interpret it literally, you would never say\\n\"Oh, he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff\\nlike that.\"  You would read \"I will make you a bare rock\" and \"You will never\\nbe rebuilt\", and you\\'d conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock.  The only way\\nto get from `fishing nets\\' to `houses and buildings and a medium-large\\npopulation\\' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there.\\n\\nIn other words, your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the\\nprophecy at the time it was written.  There is no way that, given a literal\\nreading, they could read this passage and conclude \"medium-size city\".\\n\\nYou seem to feel that \"Never be rebuilt\" means \"be rebuilt\" -- maybe so, but\\nit is hardly a `clear implication\\'.\\n\\n\\nMr King also writes:\\n\\n> So far I\\'ve seen stated figurers ranging from 15,000 to 22,000.\\n> Let\\'s assume the latter one is correct.  By modern standards\\n> we are talking about a one-horse town.\\n\\nWell, no.  That\\'s only a bit less than the population of Annapolis, where I\\'m\\nfrom.  You know, the Naval Acadamy, the state capital, George Washington\\nresigned his commission in the statehouse?  Annapolis may not be New York, but\\nit\\'s at least a two-horse town.\\n\\nBut supposing 22,000 people is a \"small town\" -- it\\'s still 22,000 people\\nMORE than Ezekiel predicted.\\n\\n\\nAnd you\\'ve said nothing about the other problem.  In chapter 26, Ezekiel\\npredicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their\\nvaluables.  However, Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre, and in chapter 29\\nEzekiel even quotes God as saying \"he and his army got no reward from the\\ncampaign he led against Tyre.\"\\n\\nLet\\'s ignore Alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26.\\nEzekiel says N. would destroy Tyre, and N. did NOT destroy Tyre.  Ezekiel says\\nthat N. would plunder their valuables, but N. did NOT plunder their valuables.\\n\\nRegardless of what you think about Tyre _now_, the fact is that N. died before\\nthe place was destroyed.  Ezekiel said N. was going to do it, and N. did not.\\n\\n *\\n\\nThis post is, of course, pointless.  Inerrantists have an amazing ability\\nto rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say.\\n\\nFor example, I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26\\nby pulling some \"clear implications\" out of hat.\\n\\nWhen Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your towers\", that clearly implied\\nthat the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers\\nused to be.  And when Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your fine houses\\nand throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea\", that clearly implied\\nthat N. would never set foot on the island.  And when Ezekiel wrote that N.\\nwould \"build a ramp up to your walls\", that clearly implies that N. would\\nspend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the\\nwalls.\\n\\nSee?  A few \"clear implications\" that are totally contrary to the text, and\\nyou can reconcile anything you want.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\"[Do] You know why I\\'m the enabler?

In addition, the four gospel accounts\\n>        are very much in harmony.  \\n\\nBill, I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the\\nJosephus reference to be an early Christian insert.  By biblical scholar I mean\\nan expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the\\nchips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise be\\ndefined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They are\\nnot trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).\\n\\nWhy an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringly\\nout of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere \\nin his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which \\nit lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.\\n\\nUntil you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about\\nthe Josephus insert, your \"proof\" is meaningless and it should not be repeated\\nhere.  What\\'s more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would \"prove\"\\nnothing.  Scholars speak of the \"weight of evidence.\"  Far more independent\\nevidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, your\\nbelief is based on faith.  That\\'s OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass\\nfaith off as fact.\\n\\nAs for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring\\ninconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn\\'t a perfect canon be perfect? \\nShouldn\\'t there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel \\nFictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for \\nHerb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share \\nan evolutionary ancestry).\\n\\nThe fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny\\nyour position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels \"prove\" your faith. \\nIndependent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already\\ndiscussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith. \\nMoreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attempted\\nto \"prove\" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different than\\nsaying \"I am right because I say so.\"  \\n\\nYour logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian \\nGeneral Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where\\n\"fundamentalist\" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1)\\nJesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily\\nresurrected, 4) Jesus\\' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the\\nclincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe\\n\"inerrant\" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take the\\nfirst four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant\\nbible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to \\ncontain the first four.  \\n\\nSmoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!\\n\\nIts faith, Bill.  You don\\'t have any more or better truths than anyone else. \\nWhatever works for you.  Just don\\'t foist it on others. \\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nRich Fox, Anthro, Usouthdakota\\n',\n",

OK ?\\nLet me try to explain what that tower is used to:\\n   -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.\\n         It has an hightech \"boiler\" but the rest is still verry verry \\n         conventional. And if you\\'ve already visited any condensation-\\n         powerstation you\\'l have seen the cooling towers too.\\n         If you look at any good book about thermophysics you\\'ll find\\n         a chapter about the \"CARNOT-process\" which describes how to\\n         get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason\\n         for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you\\'ve an\\n         temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one \\n         side and need to cool down the steam \\'till you get water\\n         again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the \\n         energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to\\n         let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and \"cold\"\\n         steam on the other side you\\'ll loose much more of the energy.\\n         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of\\n         energy that carnot will give them.\\n         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !\\n         The vapor you\\'ll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,\\n         because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in\\n         AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent\\n         radioactive pollution of the environment !\\n         \\n   -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-\\n         Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still\\n         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere\\n         around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you\\'ll have lot\\'s of problems with\\n         the boiler\\'s steel. That\\'s because at this temperature the\\n         metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.\\n         This is only for BWR\\'s. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures\\n         up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental. \\n\\n   -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever\\n         possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the\\n         years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won\\'t be 0.75 mRem\\n         at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you\\'ll still have\\n         1.5 mRem.

Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in\\nany ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference\\npower, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which\\nshould also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms\\nin an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted\\nnotation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of\\nthe circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*\\n(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted\\nreference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.\\nSo. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation\\nsuch as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.\\n\\nFor power:\\n\\n  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )\\n\\nFor amplitude\\n\\n  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )\\n\\n'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base\\n10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.\\nIt has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for\\nthe common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation\\nconvention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.\\n\\nCommon references for audio are:\\n\\n\\t0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms\\n\\t0 dBV = 1 volt\\n\\n\\t0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)\\n\\t0 VU = -10dBV\\t(consumer gear line level)\\n\\n\\nOften times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using\\nthe rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all\\ndone to whatever reference is reasonable for the application\\nor moment.\\n\\nNote that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear\\nimpedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the\\npower will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done\\nwith the above two identities and ohm's law.\\n\\n-- \\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n       Dave Medin\\t\\t\\tPhone:\\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\\n    SSD--Networking\\t\\t\\t\\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\\n    Intergraph Corp.\\n       M/S GD3004 \\t\\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\\t\\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\\n\\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\\n\\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)\\n\",\n",

The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road. \\nA worse scenario: The same rider, same turn. In the middle of the turn\\nthe rider sees a truck coming towards him/her.

              " '\\n\\nThe article that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993\\nissue of USA Today (\"Drug Use Up Among U.S. eighth-graders\" by Mike\\nSnider, p. 6D).\\n\\n    A new national survey says drugs are easier to get, more teens are\\n    using them and fewer deem drug use as risky. \\n\\n    For the last two years, government officials have trumpeted results\\n    from the National High School Survey as signs that the drug war is\\n    being won.  But this year, officials are retreating - drug use by\\n    eighth-graders has risen, according to the survey of 50,000 students\\n    nationwide.\\n\\n    Possible reason for the increase:  more experimentation.  Why?  If\\n    drug use dropped during the \\'80s, eventually some students will\\n    have fewer \"drug-using contemporaries\" who act as examples of\\n    substance abuse\\'s drawbacks, says social psychologist Lloyd Johnston,\\n    one of the survey authors.  Each new wave of youths \"must be given\\n    the knowledge, skills and motivation to resist using these drugs,\"\\n    Johnston says.\\n\\n    This type of resurgence \"is possible,\" says Eileen Shiff, author of\\n    \"Experts Advise Parents\" (Delta, $14.95).  But that\\'s not the issue,\\n    she says.  The prevalence of alcohol and drugs among teens today\\n    could result in more alcoholic adults decades from now.\\n\\n    Aggravating the problem:  baby boomer parents - who experimented with\\n    drugs and alcohol as teens - trying to be friends, not parents, to\\n    their children.  \"I\\'ve even seen parents serving kegs of beer\" to\\n    their underage kids and friends, Shiff says.  For a recent graduation,\\n    Shiff and other parents organized an all-night, \"lock-in\" party where\\n    no booze or drugs were allowed.  \"We need to fulfill that parental\\n    role, otherwise the peer group takes over,\" she says.\\n\\n    Officials may \"talk about the war on drugs, but they really haven\\'t\\n    done anything that I\\'ve seen,\" says Suzanne Linkous, Scottsdale,\\n    Ariz., 16, a volunteer who talks with teens about drugs, dating and\\n    other issues on a peer counseling and suicide hot line.  Linkous, a\\n    member of USA Today\\'s Teen Panel, says \"there\\'s always going to be\\n    experimentation\" with drugs.\\n\\n    A real war on drugs could be waged \"education-wise,\" she says.  But\\n    \"some don\\'t want to give kids the facts.  They think it will give\\n    them ideas; it\\'s the same with birth control.  I think you should\\n    give the kids the information or have it accessible\" through classes,\\n    pamphlets and speakers, she says.\\n\\n    Education efforts need to start as soon as kids get in school - in\\n    kindergarten, says Dallas Owens, 17, teen panelist from Miami Shores,\\n    Fla.  \"I remember in kindergarten, I used to see (drugs).

The only things the Earth is at the exact center\\nof are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of comets\\nway beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories, placing\\nGRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies to\\nbe released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud models\\ntend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics.\\n\\nIf GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy)\\nyou would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane of\\nthe Galaxy (for a 'disk' population), or towards the Galactic center\\n(for a spherical 'halo' population).  We don't see this, so if they\\nare Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years in\\nradius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the Andromeda\\nGalaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)

Just give me the cheapest\\nheaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I\\ndon\\'t have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I\\'ll use it.\\n\\nBut back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a\\nlow cost (it\\'s all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General\\nDynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper\\nstage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two\\nunmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. \\nTotal cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9\\nbillion for the US share.\\n\\nI didn\\'t find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I\\'d bet that\\nits  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric\\ntonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew\\nhabitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for\\nthe additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be\\nable to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,\\nthat\\'s a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors\\neats up a bit of LOX.  And I\\'m not certain if a home brewed (or\\ncollege-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let\\'s round\\nthis up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton\\npayloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two\\nLEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a\\nyear.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of\\ndelivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone\\nhave a more precise guess about how much a year\\'s supply of consumables and\\nequipment would weigh?\\n\\nAnd I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded\\nto burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? \\nHenry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10\\nengines.  Aren\\'t they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? \\nI\\'ve forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the\\nDC-1.\\n\\nAll in all, I\\'m not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the\\nmoon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first\\nnon-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned\\nmoon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from\\nlunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find\\nsome way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal\\nmight result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared\\nto win.  And for those that didn\\'t give up, I find something a little scary\\nabout a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I\\'d\\nlike to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.\\n\\nLastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an\\nEnglish space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on\\nthe cheap.

I\\nhave seen the film called \"The Gay Agenda\" and along with my church we found\\nit to be horrifying.  Not because of what was actually shown (cleaver use of\\neditting can create any image one wants to portray), rather becaseu we are familia\\nfamiliar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people\\nare actually believing the garbage found within it.  The truth is that neither\\nyou nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing as\\nmany as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life\\nI have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, something\\nobviously claimed against gays as well.  The truth is that unless YOU are\\ninnately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing.  I speak as an\\nabolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society.  I do not\\nsupport wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian\\nFundamentalist extremists, but I know people who are not the sexual deviants\\nyour report paints them to be.  It is no mistake that the APA removed\\nhomosexuality from it\\'s list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake that\\nthere are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list.\\nI do not feel threatened by gays, I don\\'t understand why others are.\\n\\nThe following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min-\\nistries:  Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous.\\n\\nTHE FOUNDER OF AN \"EX-GAY\" SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO\\n\\nby Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)\\n\\nIn December 1985, David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate\\'s homophobia rewaa\\nawards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREE\\nINDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering\\ndiscontented gays and lesbians \"a way out of the homosexual death-style\"\\nthrough prayer.  \"I\\'d like to give the award back,\" Caligiuri now laughs, \"I\\'m\\nno longer deserve it.\"\\n  Caligiuri\\'s eight year involvement with the national \"ex-gay\" movement peaked\\nwith his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well\\nas Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex-\\ngay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  \"There\\'s no reality\\nin it,\" he says, \"I was selling a product, and my product was a lie.\"\\n  Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the\\norganizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again\\nChristianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who\\nare just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their\\nsexual urges and embracing Christianity.  \"We offer support to people who are\\nseeking to leave the sin of homosexuality,\" explains Bob Davies, director of\\nExodus.  He ventures that \"about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo-\\nsexuality are men.\"\\n  \"Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting\\ntheir time,\" says Lisa Seeley, a former \"redeemed lesbian\" who worked with\\nCaligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  \"These\\norganizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded.\"\\n  \"It\\'s possible to change your identity or your behavior,\" says sex educator\\nBrian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. \"But it\\'s really impossible to\\nchange your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay,\\nbut they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings.\"\\n  Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all\\nhell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both\\ntheir romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted\\nby a man he picked up in a bar.  \"I was really drunk,\" he recalls, \"and I\\nwent home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all\\nnight, and the next morning he raped me again.\"\\n  When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the\\nhome he shared with his ex-lover.  \"He had another man there with him,\"\\nCaligiuri recalls.  \"I thought at this time, \\'If this is what being gay is\\nabout, I don\\'t want to be this way anymore.\"\\n  Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery\\nwith others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix\\'s\\ngay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its\\nfirst public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance,\\nFree Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed\\nfor hell.\\n  Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks\\nin part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  \"We were listed\\nunder Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services,\" Caligiuri says, \"so people\\nthought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out\\nwhere the local bars were, and we\\'d preach to them about the sins of homo-\\nsexuality.\"  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says,\\nadding, \"They\\'ll do anything to reach these people.\"\\n  \"David used to go on radio and say really stupid things,\" recalls Peter\\nKelly, a counselor at Phoenix\\'s Catholic diocese AIDS program, \"like that\\nhe knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors.\"\\n  Caligiuri\\'s family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on\\nRaphael\\'s syndicated talk show in 1985.  \"They were relieved,\" he recalls.\\n\"They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better\\nthat I should be a \\'reformed\\' gay person.\"\\n  But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  \"By the time I appeared on Sally\\'s\\nshow,\" \"I\\'d started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline\\nand tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their\\nfather.  I was horny all the time.\"\\n  Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his\\nnumerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he \"used to go to bookstores\\nand get blowjobs.\"  When he wasn\\'t working the bookstores, he was sleeping\\nwith other \"reformed\" homosexuals.\\n  \"I didn\\'t realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex\\nwith one another,\" Caligiuri says.  \"We\\'d go to conferences in other cities,\\nand we\\'d be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody\\nelse.\"\\n  By the time he appeared on \\'AM Philadelphia\\' television show in May 1988,\\nCaligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show\\'s\\nhost asked him if he ever \"acted on temptation,\" his answer was a lie.\\n  Caligiuri\\'s duplicity began to take it\\'s toll on him, however.  He was\\nsuffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating\\nyeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  \"I was too sick\\nto go to church,\" he explains.  \"The more time I spent away from those people\\nthe more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be.\"\\n  Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local\\nchurch and closed the ministry\\'s doors.  \"I\\'d convinced myself that there\\nis no need in the world for ex-gay people,\" he says.\\n  Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities (\"I\\'m interest-\\ned in belief systems that aren\\'t judgemental.\"), considering romance (\"But\\nnot with a CHristian!\"), and searching for a new project to devote himself to.\\n\"I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes,\" he says.  \"I want to\\neventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I\\nmay have brought to our community.\"\\n\\n---end article---\\n\\nCaligiuri\\'s tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles\\nof former leaders and founders of \\'ex-gay\\' ministries who have said very similar th\\nsimilar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have\\ncome to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some,\\nlike Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian \"Lazarus Project\" of West\\nHollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community\\nto bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values\\nof sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become\\nand become close friends with many who once attended such groups as \"Love In\\nAction\" and others, who either once claimed to have been \"reformed\" or who\\nwere too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed\\nin them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of \"sealing\" their\\nnew heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses\\nand bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of\\nnight and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous \"sin\"\\nthrough a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch\\nhas dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno-\\ncent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet\\nthe church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow\\ngay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also\\nmrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and\\nfear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on\\nthem, they may even opt for \\'suicide\\' or surgical dampering of the brain\\nfunctions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common-\\nplace.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the\\nthreat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington\\'s\\n_\"Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact\\nbased books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as\\nMaury Johnston\\'s _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser\\'s _Come Hom!_.

In fact, your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader \\nfor other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained.  \\n\\nBut the evidence does not support this contention.  Rather, it appears that\\nprice controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of\\nservice and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide \\ncomparable benefits.  Providers continue to profit from RD, they simply\\nmake less on each treatment than they would have if the price had \\nrisen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have.\\n\\nThere is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD \\nsubstantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday\\npredictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restriction\\nof service, lagging technological development, etc.  Likewise, it appears\\nthat in the VA and armed forces medical care systems, where providers \\nare government agencies, some of these negative impacts may occur.  \\n(RD patients in the VA system in Spokane, for example, must travel to\\nSeattle, 300 miles away, for treatment.)  \\n\\nThe bottom line, however, is that this is an example of government \\nintervention (of a rather extreme sort) that appears to have had beneficial\\nresults for both providers and consumers.

How do I become an astronaut?\\n\\n    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it\\'s probably\\n    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying\\n    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have\\n    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you\\'re better off hoping to\\n    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet\\n    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you\\n    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle \"mission\\n    specialist\".\\n\\n    If you aren\\'t a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,\\n    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly\\n    exceeds the supply.  NASA\\'s problem is not finding qualified people,\\n    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.\\tIt is not enough\\n    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,\\n    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.\\n\\n    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands\\n    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer\\n    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-\\n    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in\\n    another seems to be a frequent winner.\\n\\n    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.\\t(DO NOT get a\\n    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows\\n    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term\\n    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other\\n    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,\\n    you should be okay; if you can\\'t, your chances are poor.\\n\\n    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in\\n    appearance and actions; you\\'ve got a tough selling job ahead, trying\\n    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you\\n    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you\\n    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is\\n    a significant part of the job, and NASA\\'s image is very prim and\\n    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.\\n    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,\\n    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.\\n    Keep your nose clean.\\n\\n    Get a pilot\\'s license and make flying your number one hobby;\\n    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.\\n\\n    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,\\n    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were\\n    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).\\n    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job\\n    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant \"you\\n    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first\".\\n\\n    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance\\n    to demonstrate motivation.\\n\\n    Keep trying.

Johnson Space Center\\n    Houston, Texas\\n\\n    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates\\n    ==================================================================\\n\\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\\n    ---------------------------\\n\\n    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for\\n    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates\\n    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a\\n    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.\\n\\n    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be\\n    considered.\\n\\n    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in\\n    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation\\n    program.\\n\\n    Space Shuttle Program Description\\n    ---------------------------------\\n\\n    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated\\n    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming\\n    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in\\n    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then\\n    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and\\n    flight crew.\\n\\n    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment\\n    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation\\n    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials\\n    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will\\n    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space\\n    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher\\n    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space\\n    Shuttle\\'s capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include\\n    government agencies and private industries.\\n\\n    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,\\n    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are\\n    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA\\n    astronauts.\\n\\n    Pilot Astronaut\\n\\n    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.\\n    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,\\n    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the\\n    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the\\n    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing\\n    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other\\n    payload operations.\\n\\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut\\n\\n    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,\\n    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations\\n    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and\\n    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to\\n    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed\\n    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and\\n    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the\\n    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission\\n    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling\\n    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific\\n    experimental operations.\\n\\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\\n    ===========================\\n\\n    Basic Qualification Requirements\\n    --------------------------------\\n\\n    Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to\\n    submitting an application.\\n\\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate:\\n\\n    1.

Application\\n    procedures will be disseminated by each service.\\n\\n    Selection\\n    ---------\\n\\n    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required\\n    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.\\n    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered\\n    will be notified of the outcome of the process.\\n\\n    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the\\n    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following\\n    their establishment.\\n\\n    General Program Requirements\\n\\n    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be\\n    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,\\n    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and\\n    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or\\n    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to\\n    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut\\n    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills\\n    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot\\n    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during\\n    their candidate period.\\n\\n    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does\\n    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut\\n    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and\\n    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the\\n    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become\\n    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for\\n    a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not\\n    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA\\n    depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that\\n    time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a\\n    specified tour of duty.\\n\\n    NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified\\n    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.\\n    Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.\\n\\n    Pay and Benefits\\n    ----------------\\n\\n    Civilians\\n\\n    Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal\\n    Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,\\n    and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements\\n    and experience.\\n\\n    Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and\\n    participation in group health and life insurance plans.\\n\\n    Military\\n\\n    Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center\\n    but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and\\n    other similar military matters.\\n\\n\\nNEXT: FAQ #15/15 - Orbital and Planetary Launch Services\\n',\n",

The vehicle\\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\\n     source for 30 day missions.\\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\\n     Partners\\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\\n     add another 20 kW of power\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\\n     Vehicle).\\n\\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\\nhave all come to know and love :)\\n\\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \\nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\\n\\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\\n     it visits.\\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\\n     assembly in 24 flights.\\n\\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \\nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\\nchanges.\\n\\nOption C - Single Core Launch Station.\\nThis is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diameter\\ncylinder that\\'s 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on\\nthe backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a \\nregular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket\\nmotors, and launch the can. Some key features are:\\n  - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout\\n  - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels\\n  - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against\\n    micrometeroid & orbital debris)\\n  - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)\\n  - 7 berthing ports\\n  - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet\\n    (twice the volume of skylab).\\n  - 7 floors, center passageway between floors\\n  - 10 kW of housekeeping power\\n  - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal\\n    loops, dual environmental control & life support system)\\n  - increased crew time for utilization\\n  - 1 micro-g thru out the core module\\n',\n",

PST\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING \\non the aid package.\\n\\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The \\nPresident -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed \\nyesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic \\nand political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.  \\n\\n\\t     Before taking your questions and running through the \\nbasic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.  \\nFirst, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do \\nwith available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds \\nhave been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is \\nno need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund \\nany of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently \\nare available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin \\ntomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The second point is that this package is designed to \\nsupport Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package \\nare directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have \\nbeen worked out with prior consultation with the Russian \\ngovernment.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Third, the President is determined that we will \\ndeliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed \\nto maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we \\nwanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we \\nfeel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in \\nfront of you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of \\ntrade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's \\ncapital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend \\nwell into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of \\ngovernments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do \\nso.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make \\ntrade and investment a major priority in the relationship.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     They also agreed that there would be a new joint \\ncommission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by \\nVice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister \\nChernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through \\nthe barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote \\na vastly expanded relationship.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down \\nthe first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just \\ngive you some general background on what these programs are.  \\nI'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food \\nand medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has \\nbeen underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian \\ngrant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure \\nthere's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the \\nmajor cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food \\nfor Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also \\nbe continuing our grant assistance in medicines and \\npharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The second item is concessional food sales.  As you \\nknow, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship \\nwith Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia \\nthat we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the \\nFood for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.  \\nThe value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are \\nconcessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out, \\nbut I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on \\nprincipal of six or seven years, and concessional rates \\nthereafter for the life of the deal.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The third program is a collection of private sector \\nsupport.  We think this is one of the most important things we're \\ngoing to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses \\nis the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.  \\nAnd so the President has decided to create a Russian-American \\nenterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the \\ngoal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in \\nRussia, to take equity positions in those businesses.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The President has also decided to create a \\nprivatization fund which would work directly with the Russian \\ngovernment in its priority objective of trying to convert state \\nenterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has \\nalso agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a \\nEurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by \\nprominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The fourth grouping you see there in the summary \\npage is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that \\nthis administration has given a new impetus to the goal of \\npursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total \\nof $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed \\ntables give an indication of some of the programs that we're \\nlaunching.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The President is also calling for the development of \\na democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to \\ntry to incorporate all of the disparate private and public \\nefforts now underway from the United States to support reform in \\nRussia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The fifth program you see is Russian office of \\nresettlement.  This is a new initiative created and \\nconceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration \\nproject.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military \\nto help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic \\nstates and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to \\nmake sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's \\nwith Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American \\nconstruction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration \\nbasis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working \\nvery closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say \\nthat we have a long-term commitment to this project.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They \\nare two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our \\ninitial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the \\npossibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and \\ngas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in \\nthe oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much \\nenvironmental damage.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I've talked a little bit about trade and investment, \\nabout the new group being created that the Vice President will \\nchair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing \\nwith Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development \\ncommittee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy, \\nto break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede \\ntrade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time \\ninvestment ombudsman in the American government to work on this \\nproblem full-time.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and \\ninvestment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an \\nanalogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we \\njust thought that in looking at this we needed to make a \\ncommitment within our own government to have people work on it -- \\nsenior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly \\nimportant.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You'll notice that the United States is going to \\nsupport Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer \\nstatus.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested \\nour advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the \\nlong-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is \\nparamount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are \\nsupporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting \\ntheir access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in \\ncredit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended \\n$150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil \\nproject.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an \\nagreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion \\nframework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance \\nRussian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services. \\nWe think this is a very important development.  We think we'll \\nget there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo \\nconference, the G-7 conference.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Before I take any further questions, I'd like to \\ndefer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance \\nobjectives with you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major \\nunfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts \\nin Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and \\nsecure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory \\nunder the terms of the START I and START II agreements.   \\nRecently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important \\nagreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding \\nto three important programs.  The first is the program of $130 \\nmillion for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement \\nprogram.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for \\nbomber dismantlement -- $130 million.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for \\nthe construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed \\nfrom the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially \\ncontribute to the overall design and the early phases of the \\nconstruction of that storage facility.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help \\nin the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear \\nmaterials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we \\nadd that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance \\nwhich has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall \\nsafety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety \\nmeasures that we have been working out with the Russians over the \\nlast couple of years.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So this is an area where we will be going a lot more \\nwork with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks, \\nand Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last \\ncouple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for \\nsafety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian \\nterritory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of \\nSTART I, an agreement to accede to NPT. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we are working very hard with all the parties to \\nthe Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with \\nthem.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia \\nas a very important step in that process.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in \\nKazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with \\nKazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the \\nsame one, why do you feel it's necessary?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same \\ndeal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil \\nfield.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights \\noil development and renovation project, and it's being announced \\ntoday.  So it's completely new.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you tell us more about what's involved?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like \\nother American oil companies has been searching for ways to do \\ntwo things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west \\nSiberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating \\noil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.  \\nThe objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the \\nnatural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which \\nwill, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what \\nRussia needs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we think this deal is very, very good development \\nfor Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an \\nAmerican company.  And the American government has played a \\nleading role in pulling this together through the credit facility \\nin OPIC and through the loan guarantee.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So it's to search and also to renovate fields \\nthat are already there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On that point, should other American companies \\nexpect to get administration support for such deals, or should \\nthey now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2 \\nbillion?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know, \\nEx-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the \\nU.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department \\nand the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we \\nthink it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th, \\nthere will be $2 billion in financing available for American \\ncompanies to sell their equipment and sell their services.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That should take up all of the rest of the \\ndeals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be \\nsupport for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a \\ntremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas \\ncompanies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and \\ngas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will \\nsoak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may \\neven extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What's the current year budget costs of that \\n$2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any \\ncurrent year budget costs --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer \\nyou to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The concessional food sales -- is there any \\ncurrent year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in \\nwhich the payments are due?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional \\nfood sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.  \\nUSDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to \\nexpend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd \\nrefer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     and the private sector -- how many folks are \\ngoing to be involved in that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start \\nwith the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt \\ncoming into office that there were literally thousands of \\norganization, private organizations in the United States that in \\none way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve \\ndemocratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.  \\nAnd there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that \\nhad a variety of programs in this area.  And so the \\nadministration felt -- the President felt it was important to try \\nto draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give \\nsome coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the \\nefforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will \\nsoon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in \\nthe former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might \\nuse this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of \\nour own government, but the resources of the American private \\nsector and schools and communities across the nation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word \\nyet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated \\nbesides the $300 million the President talked about?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration \\nis requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What \\nthe President has done this weekend is to consult really \\nintensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional \\nmeasures the United States could take in some of these areas to \\nsupport reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he \\nreturns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other \\nally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Two questions about the $700 billion \\nagricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of \\nconsensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.  \\nSo why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you \\nexplain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans \\nfor food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit \\ninto that situation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the \\nUnited States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains \\nand food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think \\nbetween 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history \\nhere -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through \\nthe Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle \\nto ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of \\nlast year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on \\nthat program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and \\ntherefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that \\nprogram.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and \\nother officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we \\ncould promote American grain sales.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've \\nannounced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the \\nFood for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient \\nauthority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked \\nfor a concessional loan program.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a \\nshort-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but \\na long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what \\nthis program is.  It will provide, once the final details are \\nworked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of \\nprincipal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the \\nlife of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of \\ninterest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we \\nbelieve and the Russian government believes this is a good deal \\nfor them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments \\nand put them into the out years, but it will also continue this \\nvery important grain relationship, which is important for them, \\nand it's important for the American farm community.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I gather from what you say that this could make \\nit explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC \\nloan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, \\nis that right? \\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit \\nabout that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing  \\nthe Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program \\nbecause of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you \\nknow about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around \\n$640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having \\ntaken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American \\nmarket share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to \\nrespond to a specific request from the Russian government for \\nmajor food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the \\ngrant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there, \\nwe looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to \\ngreat effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with \\nthe Russian government and arrived at this solution.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think the Russians are pleased because it provides \\nthem with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on \\nthe short-term payments.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where do those funds actually come from?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the \\nFood for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's \\nauthority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do \\nnot need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want \\nto make that general point again:  Everything in this package, \\nthe $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been \\nallocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration \\ncan begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very \\nimportant in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, \\nthat we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be \\nable to do so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How did you arrive at the figure of $700 \\nmillion -- does that max out that program, or did you actually \\nhave a range from 0 to --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason \\nfor it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us \\nthat's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and \\nharvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the \\nshipments probably $100 million per month from now until the \\nharvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the \\nsame level of food imports from the West.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I would imagine there's going to be some \\nconsiderable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other \\nrepublics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.  \\nHave you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for \\nthe same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with \\nsome of the other republics?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very \\nconscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending \\nAmerican support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet \\nUnion.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the \\narea of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that \\nyou see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and \\nroughly 50 percent to the other countries. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     In the area of food sales, we have been active with \\nUkraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We \\nwill continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this \\nsummit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the \\nother countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are \\nproductive and they're hard-hitting.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has anything happened at the summit to lead \\nAmerican energy companies and other companies to believe that \\nRussia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of \\ntaxing, legalities, bureaucracy?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our \\nprimary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not \\nonly the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd \\nlike to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're \\nconvinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to \\nsupport Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of \\nWestern governments have the financial resources over the next \\ndecade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private \\nsector can do that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We look at our own society and we see tremendous \\ncapability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very \\ngood match with what the Russians need now, which is financial \\ninvestment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new \\ntechnology and new capital to finance new production.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     That's what the Russian government has told us it \\nwants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis \\non it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on \\nthe first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently \\nlast night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President \\nClinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong \\nsignal to the American business community that we support their \\nefforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex-\\nIm and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to \\nsupport them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to \\ndeliver on making Russia a more --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I \\nwould note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr. \\nChernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas \\nsector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice \\nPresident, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the \\nbarriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil \\nand gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that \\ncommittee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to \\nthe work.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What type of mechanism is already in place to \\nadminister the private sector portion of the program?  And will \\nthe U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of \\nthe actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the \\nRussian government for distribution at their will?\\n\\t     \\t    \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking \\nabout the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the \\nprogram itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working \\nthrough American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure \\nthat the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to \\nthe intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the \\nCongress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can \\naccount for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of \\nmonths intensively and we will continue to do it for each of \\nthese programs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But they are all quite different.  For instance, in \\nthe area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it \\nis carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of \\nthe food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working \\nthrough Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the \\nhousing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers, \\nwe'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the \\ndemocratization projects, we're working directly with Russian \\nprivate individuals and private foundations.  We're working with \\njournalists in Russia on a media project that you may have \\nnoticed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we literally have here 30 to 40 different \\nactivities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be \\ncarried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the \\nRussian government, some with Russian citizens.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and \\non the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the \\nPresident has to do on that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George \\nnoted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in \\nthe relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's \\nfair to say we will go back now in our own government when we \\nreturn to Washington and look at both of these questions, and \\nwe'll get back to the Russian government.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You were not prepared for these questions when \\nyou got here?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared \\nfor these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not \\nprepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require --\\nlet me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require \\nconsultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with \\nthe American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those \\nconcerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before \\nwe take any action.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is this package designed so that you will not \\nhave to go to Congress for anything at this point?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the \\nbeginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all \\nthe funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  \\nSo the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to \\nseek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In \\neffect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the \\nagencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And \\nthat's the advantage of this particular initiative.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If this, as the President says, is a long-term, \\nlong-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment \\nheading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to \\nCongress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are \\nprepared to go to Congress for various things?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been \\nclear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with \\nPresident Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American \\nfunding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a \\nmajor congressional delegation that left last night, headed by \\nRepresentative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that \\ndelegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.  \\nAnd we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where \\nit stands now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We've been told repeatedly that a number of \\nthese items represent different or new ways of spending the money \\nalready appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these \\nitems represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways \\nthat it was not previously set to be?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've \\nsaid that these are all projects that either Congress had \\nallocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were \\nsome funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this \\nadministration took office and had some new ideas about how the \\nfunds might be expended.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or \\nthe FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations --\\nEx-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to \\nfurther our programs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And example of that is the Food for Progress \\nconcessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of \\nfunding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we \\nlooked for a more creative way to ensure continued American \\nmarket share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we \\nfound it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where, for example, are you getting the money \\nfor this Russian officer resettlement --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the \\nFreedom Support Act funds.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In other words, all of the money is being \\ndirectly spent in new ways, so to speak --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant \\nprojects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the \\nsecond chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if \\nyou look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that \\ntotal $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act \\nfunding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year \\n'92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the \\nlegislative history of those funds.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     cooperation --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I \\ndon't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Could you tell us please, has anything happened \\nhere this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and \\nRussia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's \\nhappened here --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents, \\nPresident Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this \\nissue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security \\nand arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's \\nsession.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly \\nreinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been \\ntalking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple \\nof weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the \\ndiscussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very \\nimportant negotiation that's been going on essentially between \\nMoscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially \\ndiscussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute \\nto this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend, \\nI don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q?\\t    Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is \\nany of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current \\nyear appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been \\nearmarked and put it into this fund?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and \\nmirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We \\ncould have given you a page of assistance numbers that included \\nout-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to \\nmany of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the \\nprivatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already \\ntalked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We could have put in really big numbers and this \\ncould have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:  \\nThis package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're \\ngoing to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President \\nfeels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy \\nthat the western governments, the combination of governments, put \\nup large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not \\nable to meet them, we're determined, and the President is \\ndetermined, to carry out every single program in this package.  \\nAnd we'll do it.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's \\npart of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking \\nfor Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively \\nsupport reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment \\non some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     taken it way from any --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.  \\nOkay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds; \\nso have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in \\nRussia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In terms of funding, there is no available \\nmonies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money \\nsomewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I \\ndon't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the \\nexample is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit \\nguarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay \\nback within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt \\nproblem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we \\nlooked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement \\nfor grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and \\nalso meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers \\nhave a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply \\nlook for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative \\nauthority to do it.  This program has been successful in other \\nareas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union, \\nbut we thought we should now.\\n\\t     \\t  \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package \\nfor Russia, since these funds were really first derived by \\ninitiatives put forward by President Bush?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think \\nthat's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were \\nappropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This \\nadministration took office and inherited some obligations that \\nthe Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven \\nweek review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments \\nthat had been made by the previous administration.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But we have gone well beyond them in funding the \\nenterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not \\nbeen filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to \\nit.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them \\ninto a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say, \\nis another Clinton initiative.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Further, we listened to the Russian government and \\nlistened to the Russian military who told us that the \\nresettlement of their officers was important to them for \\npolitical and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton \\nhas responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment \\nthat beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out \\na way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I would also say that the President has given \\nimpetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly \\nabout what it is we can do on democratization, because there we \\nhave some experience and some comparative advantage that lends \\nitself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the \\ncreation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative, \\nwe're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private \\nsector as well as the American government, to achieve that \\nobjective.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And \\nas most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the \\nlast administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last \\nadministration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton \\nassistance package for Russia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the \\npast has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this \\noutside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money \\nwill not just disappear because it's being administered by the \\nRussian government?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I \\nknow that the President and other senior officials of our \\ngovernment are concerned that American money be spent wisely and \\nthat it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's \\nintended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the \\nState Department will take great care in making sure that the \\nfunds are expended properly and that they're reaching their \\nsource.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I would not that this package is not simply a \\npackage of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of \\nthese projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are \\ngoing to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals, \\nwith businesses.  The private enterprise support is another \\nexample of that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add \\na word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one \\narea that we've been looking at very, very closely is \\nconsideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting \\nfor these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely, \\nof course, with the American firms, who would be the prime \\ncontractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of \\na imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that \\nfunding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in \\nRussia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent \\nefficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly \\nwhen do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President \\nis today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think \\nit's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over \\nthe next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties \\non May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over \\nthe last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach \\nout to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us \\nto help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said \\nthat we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate \\nin a much more effective way the activities of our own \\ngovernment.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in \\nRussia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw \\nthem together and to focus their efforts.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will \\nactually be spent in the United States by American made goods?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any \\nfigures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something \\nup in the next couple of days on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  This figure is larger than the figure that has \\nbeen in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result \\nof the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think --\\nunfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and \\nI'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put \\nus to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was \\nbriefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the \\nintellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of \\nthe ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we \\nhad this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have \\nbeen refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week \\ngoing over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in \\nWashington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.  \\nAnd so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been \\ntogether for about two weeks.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There \\nwas so much talk before about the President wanted to get \\nYeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.  \\nIs that in the out years?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.  \\nPresident Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance, \\nthat support for the creation of private businesses is important \\nto him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is \\nimportant; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize \\nthe state industries is important to them.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And so what we did was to try to make those the \\ncenterpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We \\nlistened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been \\nworking with the Russian government for months on this trying to \\nwork out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of \\nthese programs was involved every step of the way.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But let me get at the other part of your question.  \\nThe President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader \\nset of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking \\nfor his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the \\ntable -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in \\nhousing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to \\nconsult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other \\nallied governments that are also active.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There's essentially nothing that happened in \\nthe last day and a half that measurably altered the package that \\nyou came in with?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular \\npackage, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks \\nago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on \\nthe final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've \\nprimarily talked about future, about what more the United States \\nand other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia, \\nwhich is our base objective here.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I noticed that you -- that money appropriated \\nto train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me \\nwhat about job training for workers who are displaced by \\nprivatization?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we \\nhave a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and \\nfinancial services in the United States.  Part of the housing \\ninitiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain \\nRussian officers who are retiring into other professions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     money for job training for workers whose \\njobs are disappearing because of privatization --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet \\nallocated any money for that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why not?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     of the $6 million is going to build 450 \\nhousing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the \\nWestern dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do \\nhousing the right way, it's not just the building the framework \\nof a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've \\ngot to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think \\nabout sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also \\nretraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming \\nout of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.  \\nWe think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers \\nas well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian \\ngovernment.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     of the $6 million will go to retrain --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you talking about apartment buildings or \\nsingle --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about \\nsingle, individual dwellings.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You're saying that only 450 families will be \\nserved by this?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I \\nthought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.  \\nWhat we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the \\nGermans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building \\nhousing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with \\na huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next \\ncouple of months and try to figure out with American \\norganizations in the private sector the best way to get this job \\ndone.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.  \\nAnd so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into \\nthis in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to \\nspend the money wisely.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is it about this program that convinces \\nyou that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be \\nin a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back, \\nespecially considering their other debt problem?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think \\nit's important to note that the United States on its own does not \\nhave the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.  \\nIt's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to \\nour allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what \\nthe Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We \\ncan simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do \\nso, which is consistent with our national interests.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the President say that the value of the \\nU.S. contribution was that it would create security and \\nprosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this \\nprogram that does this?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to \\ngo back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia, \\nand that is we want to do everything we can to support the \\ncontinuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay \\nin power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear \\nforces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction, \\nwhich are the three benefits to the United States from reform in \\nRussia.

ALL of them.\\n\\n\\t\\tDon\\'t tell me they do not exist.  They are standard\\n\\t\\tequipment.\\n\\n\\t2)  So you think Koresh fired the place, because of the explosion?\\n\\n\\t\\ta)  Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it.  This\\n\\t\\t  aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as non-flammable\\n\\t\\t  as possible.  It is as non-flammable as possible.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t.... gotcha!\\n\\n\\t\\t  ... when in isolation from other substances.\\n\\n\\t\\t  WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote\\n\\t\\t  launchers?  WHy did the FBI not announce \"this window,\\n\\t\\t  blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come\\n\\t\\t  down\", and maintain a left to right sequence?\\n\\n\\t\\tb)  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when\\n\\t\\t  mixed in, becomes a VERY flammable (and difficult to trace)\\n\\t\\t  suspension, with a VERY special property:  exposure to\\n\\t\\t  brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long\\n\\t\\t  exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will NOT tend\\n\\t\\t  to ignite.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tWhat other chemicals come up in the forensics?\\n\\t\\t\\tWho else will be allowed to test the site?\\n\\n\\t\\tc)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation\\n\\t\\t  rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made\\n\\t\\t  to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature\\n\\t\\t  above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain\\n\\t\\t  heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length\\n\\t\\t  of time (start a wall fire and wait).\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tCheck your military records; look at the tapes.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhy were tanks (large capacity delivey systems),\\n\\t\\t\\ttear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (why\\n\\t\\t\\tthe hurry. was there still a comm channel open\\n\\t\\t\\tto the outside?).\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tDo you see any trace of fire coming BACK to the\\n\\t\\t\\tcompound in the videos?

              " '\\n\\n: In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a\\n: reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. \\n\\nI\\'d say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is\\ninterpreted and what significance it\\'s given depends a great deal on\\nthe values of the observer. Science is a human activity and as such,\\nis subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human\\nactivity. The myth that scientists are above moral influence or\\nethical concern, that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure\\nfrom nature untainted by the biases of the scientist, is nonsense.\\n\\nBill\\n\\n: If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must\\n: first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering\\n: the meaning of the word \"objective\" I doubt that this will ever happen.\\n\\n: So, back to the original question:\\n\\n: And objective morality is.....?\\n\\nThis may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory.\\nObjective in the sense used here means something immutable and\\nabsolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of\\npeople. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. The\\nconcept supposedly described may have meaning however. \\nIf there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then\\nHe has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His\\nexistence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If this\\nbeing declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has\\ndefined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed,\\nHe is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically\\nself-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an\\nobjective sense.\\nIf God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective.\\nIf human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that\\nstandard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative\\nmorality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous,\\nmeaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to\\nmisunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to\\nmeet that standard is therefore objectively determined.\\nJust because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is\\ninfinitely malleable, doesn\\'t mean that the objective standard itself\\ndoesn\\'t exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural\\nnorm, or the preferred conduct of \"decent\" people, making it seem\\nsubjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard.\\nIronically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true\\nnature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being\\ncontrary to human nre, oppressive and severe. This may be due as\\n\\nBill\\nmuch to our amoral inclinations as to the standard itself, but like it\\nor not, it\\'s there.x\\n',\n",

If you\\'re feeling\\ncreative, and your favorite number hasn\\'t been taken already, you can\\nmake a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non-\\nbase-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not\\nthat you won\\'t get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)\\n\\nOh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You\\'ll\\njust be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole\\nnet, and you\\'ll look like a clueless newbie too.\\n\\nBy now you\\'re probably asking \"So who\\'s the KotL already?\". Well, as\\nJohn Sloan notes below, that\\'s about the only real \"secret\" left around\\nhere, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself,\\nnor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was\\nthe original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the\\nKotL\\'s first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely\\nwith hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line-\\noriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting\\nmessages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with \"weenie\\nmailers\"). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a\\nDead-Head.\\n\\n***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************\\n\\nOnce you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically\\ngroveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed\\nwork for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting\\nsomething done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)\\ndays, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of\\neconomic activity on the part of the KotL\\'s employers, sending yet\\nanother copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it\\njust makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an\\nexcersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at least\\nannotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request\\nwas submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think\\nthe KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).\\n\\n***********************************************************************\\n\\nOne more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren\\'t what\\nthey used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya?\\nThe typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, &\\ne-mail address. For example:\\n\\n0111:Ed Green:CA:ed.green@East.Sun.COM\\n\\n(PS: While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only\\nrequirements for DoD membership, that\\'s not strictly true these days, as\\nthere are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.)\\n\\nBlaine (Dances With Bikers) Gardner   blgardne@javelin.sim.es.com\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n            \"Denizens of Doom\", by Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161)\\n\\n      [Road Rider, August 1991, reprinted with Bruce\\'s permission]\\n\\nThere is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal \\nthings that a bunch of bikers do.  They discuss motorcycles and  \\nmotorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,  \\nhelmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve\\nseats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, \\ntraffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double \\nentendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They \\nargue with each other and plan rides together.\\n\\nThe difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, \\nalthough they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each \\nother face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world \\nand communicate with each other electronically via computer.\\n\\nThe computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;  \\nthe people range from college and university students to high-tech industry \\nprofessionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently, \\nrec.motorcycles (pronounced \"wreck-dot-motorcycles,\" it\\'s the file name for \\nthe group\\'s primary on-line \"meeting place\") carries about 2250 articles per \\nmonth;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent \\nposters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred \\nto as the DoD.\\n\\nThe DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of \\nparodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer \\nenthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, \"Denizen \\nof Doom.\"  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of \\nthe Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of \\ncourse, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.\\n\\nThe idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules \\nappealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the \\nList, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been \\nalmost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and \\nCanada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, \\nGermany, Norway and Finland.\\n\\nKeeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run \\nof 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the \\nAmerican Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser -- \\nselling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a \\nfew months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were \\ndonated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500 \\nto the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs \\nin the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.\\n\\nAs often as possible, the DoD\\'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go \\nriding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of \\nDoD\\'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California\\'s \\n\"Silicon Valley.\"  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on \\nRollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California \\n\"Joust.\"\\n\\nThe Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big \\nbarbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern \\nCalifornia ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north, \\nmeeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan \\nfor 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction \\nwith the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.\\n\\nThough it\\'s a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective \\ncommunications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional \\nmotorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in \\nsearch of two-wheeled camaraderie, it\\'s a great way for kindred spirits to \\nget together.  Long may they flame.\\n\\n\\n\"Live to Flame -- Flame to Live\"\\t[centerbar]\\n\\nThis official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which \\nyou can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do \\nanything like that face to face.  These insults are known as \"flames\";  \\nissuing them is called \"flaming.\"  Flames often start when a member \\ndisagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A \\ntypical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be \\nsomething like:  \"What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad \\nposeur!\"  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense \\nof the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding \\nability and your cat.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n          _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_\\n\\n                  by John Sloan  DoD #0011\\n\\nPeriodically the question \"What is DoD?\" is raised. This is one of\\nthose questions in the same class as \"Why is the sky blue?\", \"If there\\nis a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?\" and \"Why do\\nwomen inevitably tell you that you\\'re such a nice guy just before they\\ndump you?\", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,\\nand philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion\\nby philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the\\nhalls of academe for generations. \\n\\nA long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few\\nminutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on\\na computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two\\nmachines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another\\nvia a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but\\nwho was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of\\nthe various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and\\nsigned it \"The Denizen of Doom\". Not wishing to identify himself, he\\nasked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time\\nbecome DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit\\nabout what other people thought and generally being a right thinking\\nindividual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed. \\n\\nHe who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was\\nthe funniest thing he\\'d seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty\\neasily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom\\nMotorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership\\nnumber. \\n\\nPerhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a\\nmotorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or\\nmake or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized\\nelectronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a\\npart of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a\\ngestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the\\nsum of its parts.  It could also be that we\\'re all computer nerds who\\nwear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen\\nto also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight\\nratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open\\nminded enough to accept us as members. \\n\\nIn a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom\\nMotorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have\\nnever met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet\\nfeel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some\\nof the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized\\nand run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the\\nnetwork via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list\\n(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the\\nsame region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating\\naround the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by\\n#11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and\\ndistributed on VHS by #18)! \\n\\nWhere will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races,\\nplacing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine\\nmanagement computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each\\nparticipant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?\\nWill the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal\\nroom and at least a 386-sized UNIX system? Only time will tell. \\n\\nThe DoD has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net\\naccess and a love for motorcycles. To become a member, one need only\\nask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few\\nreally good club secrets). New members will receive via email a\\nmembership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which\\nincludes name, state, and email address. \\n\\nThe Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever (or at least\\nuntil next year when we may decided to change the name). \\n\\n                  Live to Flame - Flame to Live\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n     The DoD daemon as seen on the patches, pins, etc. by\\n\\n\\tChuck Rogers,  car377@druhi.att.com,  DoD #0003\\n \\n\\n                :-(           DoD            )-: \\n               :-(  x    __         __    x   )-:      \\n              :-(  x    / /         \\\\ \\\\    x   )-:     \\n             :-(  x    / / -\\\\-----/- \\\\ \\\\    x   )-:    \\n            :-(  L     | \\\\/  \\\\   /  \\\\/ |     F   )-:   \\n            :-(  I     | /    \\\\ /    \\\\ |     L   )-:   \\n            :-(  V     \\\\/ __   /   __ \\\\/     A   )-:   \\n            :-(  E     / /  \\\\     /  \\\\ \\\\     M   )-:   \\n            :-(        | |   \\\\   /   | |     E   )-:   \\n            :-(  T     | | . | _ | . | |         )-:   \\n            :-(  O     | \\\\___// \\\\\\\\___/ |     T   )-:   \\n            :-(         \\\\     \\\\_/     /      O   )-:   \\n            :-(  F       \\\\___     ___/           )-:   \\n            :-(  L        \\\\ \\\\     / /        L   )-:   \\n            :-(  A         \\\\ vvvvv /         I   )-:   \\n            :-(  M         | (   ) |         V   )-:   \\n            :-(  E         | ^^^^^ |         E   )-:   \\n             :-(  x        \\\\_______/        x   )-:    \\n              :-(  x                       x   )-:     \\n               :-(  x   rec.motorcycles   x   )-:\\n                :-(          USENET          )-:\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                      The DoD\\n\\n              by the Denizen of Doom    DoD #1\\n \\nWelcome one and all to the flamingest, most wonderfullest newsgroup of\\nall time: wreck.mudder-disciples or is it reak.mudder-disciples?

Many copies were made,\\nand several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in\\nunknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate\\nfor an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not\\nonly provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken\\nthe time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.\\n\\nNot only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk\\nat their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the\\nserver too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages,\\nthe general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.\\n\\nHere are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how\\nto use the archive.\\n\\n**********************************************************\\n\\nVia ftp:\\n\\ncerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]\\n\\nVia e-mail:\\n\\nThe address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of the\\nmessage.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  The\\narguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  For\\nrec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:\\n\\ndir [dod]\\nsend [dod]bruce_tanner.gif\\nsend [dod]dodframe.ps\\n\\nand you\\'ll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts\\nof bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.\\n\\nOh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to\\nthe next whole file) are send.

What patches?\\n\\nYou may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches &\\npins. And your reaction was probably: \"I want!\", or \"That\\'s sick!\", or\\nperhaps \"That\\'s sick! I want!\"\\n\\nWell, there\\'s some good news and some bad news. The good news is that\\nthere\\'s been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad\\nnews is that there isn\\'t anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn\\'t\\nbecause of any \"exclusivity\" attempt, but simply because there is no\\n\"DoD store\" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by\\nindividual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is\\nsomeone says \"I\\'m thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they\\'ll cost\\n$xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?\" Then\\norders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the\\npre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a\\nDoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or\\nproduce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all\\nthis is anarchy in action.\\n\\nHere\\'s a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and\\nperpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99),\\nmotorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts\\n(DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and\\npatches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by\\npopular demand].\\n\\nAll \"profits\" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association\\nMotorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been\\ncontributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum,\\nyou\\'ll see a large plaque on the Founders\\' Wall in the name of \"Denizens\\nof Doom, USENET, The World\", complete with a DoD pin.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHere\\'s a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.\\n\\n~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles\\n~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>\\n~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum\\n~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT\\n\\nI received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum,\\nthe other day.\\n\\n\"Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:\\n\\nCongratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the\\nDenizens of Doom!

Rides:\\n\\nSummer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its third\\nyear, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Pass\\ntrip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens got\\ntogether for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far north\\nas NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of\\nNorth Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great\\nPacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse for\\nriding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have\\ncome to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.]\\n\\nAlso worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the\\nMoab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up,\\nriding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal\\n2-strokes.  And though it\\'s not an \"official\" (as if anything could be\\nofficial with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races\\nin Steamboat Springs, Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters\\nto gather.

Even when the\\ncomfort liner is unaffected, dents and holes in the foam can seriously\\ndegrade the effectiveness of a helmet.

The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\n the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\n to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]\\n\\n  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain \\netymology. It may originally have meant \"member of the tribe,\" as in the\\nAvestan compound mogu-tbish (\"hostile to a member of the tribe\"). This meaning\\nwould have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \"member of the priestly\\ntribe\" and perhaps to \"priest\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is\\nprobably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \"Magoi\" as one of\\nthe six tribes of the Medes.\\n  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a\\npriestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were\\nresponsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their\\nknowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median\\npriesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median\\nmonarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century\\nthrough the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the\\nGreat (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political\\nand civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced\\nconcerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period\\n(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is\\ndemonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by\\nDarius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by\\nGreek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of\\nthe Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.\\n  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the\\nsacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the\\npossibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be\\nattested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.\\n  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi\\nare members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of\\nthe priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is\\nuntenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the\\nAvestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \"gift\"), is\\nnot without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,\\nin conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of\\npurity, or separation of the \"mixture\" of the two opposed principles of spirit\\nand matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as \"chorus,\" from\\nthe root mangh, which is said to mean \"sing the magic song\" (Nyberg, 1966) and\\nhas been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an\\necstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though\\nthere may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms\\nmagavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the\\nAvestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite\\na recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore\\nthe Avestan term for \"priest,\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is \\nperhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis \\n(Gershevitch, 1964).\\n  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the\\nPahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in\\nparticular derives from an older form, magupati (\"head of the Magi\"). During\\nthe Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of\\na hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (\"the high priest of\\nhigh priests\") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical\\nhierarchy.\\n  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,\\nkhwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of\\nthe corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.\\nThe corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons\\nof putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian\\ncommunity and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the\\nParsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this\\nrite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was\\nin vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with\\nwax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples\\nof Central Asia.\\n  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to\\noffer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a\\nritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the\\ncustodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the\\nrelationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was\\ncalled upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also\\nknown for the practice of killing harmful, or \"Ahrimanical,\" animals (khrafstra)\\nsuch as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,\\ntunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of\\nfelt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose\\nand mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their\\nbreath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition\\nthat is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was\\nthat of the priesthood: white.\\n  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in\\npossession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they\\ngradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of\\nprofessional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally\\ninclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been\\njealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this\\nthey were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible\\nfor teaching the prince the \"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\" and thus\\nthe \"cult of the gods.\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with\\nthe education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and\\nmaster of himself.\\n  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great\\ninfluence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite\\nseveral dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of\\nGaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself\\nSmerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -\\nthe Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,\\nin Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed\\nas a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.\\n  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were\\nrenowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of\\nthe greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men\\nwho arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in\\nBethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were\\nalso known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;\\nthis was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,\\nlike \"goes,\" \"expert in the magic arts\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the\\nChaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and\\nhad a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.\\n  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it\\nis necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called\\nwestern Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must\\nhave been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the\\nIranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in\\ncontact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in\\nvarying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.\\n  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their\\nvarying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical\\nhistorians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their\\ncustoms, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,\\nbelief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology\\nand eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi\\neven speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the\\nMagi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted\\nZoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and\\nplaced themselves under his venerable name.\\n  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the\\neastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those\\nelements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite\\noften, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the\\nZoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \"the law-abjuring\\ndaivas\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of\\ntexts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and\\npractices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first\\nchapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the\\nsupreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;\\nGathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of\\nall evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the\\nland of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it\\nhas been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the\\nabsence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own\\npriesthood, would be very strange.\\n  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the\\ncorpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the\\nfirst millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute\\ndirectly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to\\nus especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of\\nthe ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles\\nof the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\"beneficent\\nspirit\") and Angra Mainyu (\"hostile spirit\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra\\nMainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-\\nformation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-\\nastrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the\\nMesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known\\nto the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can\\nsee the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which\\nwe give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]\\n  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously\\nimportant role in the transmission of Zarathushtra\\'s treachings, as well as in\\nthe definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their\\nnatural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of\\nZoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began\\nto study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,\\nHermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises\\non the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have\\nsurvived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of\\nwisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority\\nof such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an\\nabundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).\\n  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\\nground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\\n_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\\nmost likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\\nsecond century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\nthe Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\nto Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]\\n  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the\\nreligious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,\\n1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of\\nIran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to\\nestablish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an\\northodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures\\nin the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar\\nand Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.\\n\\nSAOSHYANT:\\n  The Avestan term saoshyant (\"future benefactor\"; MPers., soshans) designates\\nthe savior of the world, who will arrive at a future time to redeem humankind.\\nThe concept of the future savior is one of the fundamental notions of Zoro-\\nastrianism, together with that of dualism; it appears as early as in the Gathas.\\nZarathushtra (Zoroaster), as the prophet of the religion, is himself a Sao-\\nshyant, one who performs his works for the Frashokereti, the end of the present\\nstate of the world, when existence will be \"rehabilitated\" and \"made splendid.\"\\n[See Frashokereti]\\n  Later Zoroastrian doctrine developed this notion into a true eschatological\\nmyth and expanded the number of Saoshyants from one to three. All the saviors\\nare born from the seed of Zarathushtra, which is preserved through the ages in\\nLake Kansaoya (identified with present-day Lake Helmand, in Seistan, Iran),\\nprotected by 99,999 fravashis, or guardian spirits. The greatest of the awaited\\nSaoshyants, the victorious Astvatereta (\"he who embodies truth\"), the son of\\nthe Vispataurvairi (\"she who conquers all\"), is the third, who will make\\nexistence splendid; he appears in Yashts 19. Upon his arrival humankind will\\nno longer be subject to old age, death, or corruption, and will be granted\\nunlimited power. At that time the dead will be resurrected, and the living will\\nbe immortal and indestructable. Brandishing the weapon with which he kills the\\npowerful enemies of the world of truth (that is, the world of the spirit, and\\nof asha), Astvatereta will look upon the whole of corporeal existence and\\nrender it imperishable. He and his comrades will engage in a great battle with\\nthe forces of evil, which will be destroyed.\\n  The name Astvatereta is clearly the result of theological speculation\\n(Kellens, 1974), as are those of his two brothers, Ukhshyatereta, \"he who makes\\ntruth grow,\" and Ukhshyatnemah, \"he who makes reverence grow\"; the names of the\\nthree virgins (Yashts 13) who are impregnated with the seed of Zarathushtra\\nwhen they bathe in Lake Kansaoya and give birth to the Saoshyants, are equally\\nspeculative. Each of these Saoshyants will arrive at the beginning of a\\nmillennium, initiating a new age and a new cycle of existence; Astvatereta will\\nappear in the third and final millennium to save mankind.\\n  The doctrine of the future savior had already taken shape in the Archaemenid\\nperiod (sixth to fourth century BCE). It was not, perhaps the principal element\\nin the formation of the messianic idea, but it was certainly a determining\\nfactor, one that enjoyed great success in the Hellenistic period beyond the\\nconfines of the Iranian world. A similar concept, that of the future Buddha,\\nMaitreya, was most likely indebted to it, and Christian messianism can trace\\nits roots to the same source.\\n',\n",

An awful lot of the\\nstarvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic\\npolicies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical\\nWesterner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible\\nmalnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can\\nbe fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They\\nhave to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans\\nwe encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre\\nidea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they\\'ve got.\\n\\nPerhaps it\\'s more accurate to say that there\\'s a Western ethic against\\nWestern infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children\\nare dying in the Third World, we couldn\\'t give a shit.  And that goes for the\\nsupposed \"Pro-Life\" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by\\nfighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against\\nabortion.  Hell, if they\\'re only interested in fetuses, they could save more\\nof those by fighting for human rights in China.\\n\\nAnd besides, Suzanne\\'s answer implies that non-Western countries lack this\\nethic against infanticide.

This sequence covers spacecraft activity\\nfrom April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay\\nAntenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to\\n11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.\\n\\n3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss\\ntimer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify\\nthe health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment\\ndata; long term trend analysis is continuing.\\n\\n6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the\\noptimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary\\nanalysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation\\nindex is near the optimal level.\\n\\n7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.\\nPreliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.\\n\\n8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster\\nflushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed\\nduring the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.\\n\\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant\\nchanges (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads\\n19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These\\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\\nanomaly team.\\n\\n10.

Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test\\nfor the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21\\n(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify\\nthe flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller\\n(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement\\nfor the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry\\nrates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry\\nSubsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The\\n10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was\\nnot metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS\\ndata from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of\\nthe TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.\\n\\n\\nTRAJECTORY\\n\\n     As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\\nstatus was as follows:\\n\\n\\tDistance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU)\\n\\tDistance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU)\\n\\tHeliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour\\n\\tDistance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km\\n\\tRound Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 seconds\\n\\n\\nSPECIAL TOPIC\\n\\n1.

In other\\n>words technically speaking Christians should use Saturday and not Sunday\\n>as their holy day, if they want to conform to the teachings of Jesus.\\n\\nI think the passage you\\'re looking for is the following.\\n\\nMatthew 5:17    \"Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the \\nprophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them. \\nMatthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, \\nnot an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. \\nMatthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments \\nand teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he \\nwho does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of \\nheaven. \\nMatthew 5:20   For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of \\nthe scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. \\n\\nThere are several problems with this.  The most serious is that the\\nLaw was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but\\nnot on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human\\nbeings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The\\nissue that the Church had to face after Jesus\\' death was what to do\\nabout Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to\\nimpose the Law on them didn\\'t say that the Law was abolished.  It\\nsimply acknowledged that fact that it didn\\'t apply to Gentiles.  This\\nis a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to.\\n(A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded\\nin Acts 15.)\\n\\nHowever there\\'s more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the\\nrole of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul\\'s apparent\\nrejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus\\' commendation of\\nthe Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a\\npurpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this\\nissue isn\\'t one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his\\ndiscussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and\\nassures us that that\\'s not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees\\nthe Law as primarily being present to convict people of their\\nsinfulness.  But ultimately it\\'s an impossible standard, and one that\\nhas been superceded by Christ.  Paul\\'s comments are not the world\\'s\\nclearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the\\ninteresting thing to notice is that even this radical position does\\nnot entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an\\nuncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.\\nFor its purpose of convicting of sin, it\\'s important that it not be\\nrelaxed.  However for Christians, it\\'s not the end -- ultimately we\\nlive in faith, not Law.\\n\\nWhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\\nend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\\nquoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\\nLaw.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading,\\nbut in fact that\\'s not Jesus\\' approach.  Jesus\\' interpretations\\nemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\\ndetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\\ntowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\\n5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\\ndiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\\ntenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\\nreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\\nplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\\nLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\\nPaul\\'s conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\\n\"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite\\nconcerned about maintaining moral standards.\\n\\nThe net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe\\nthey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is\\nembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters\\nresponding to specific situations, he\\'s looking at the aspect of the\\nLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish\\nceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\\nof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems\\nto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and\\nhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later\\nto give Paul so much trouble.\\n\\nIt\\'s unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but\\nwe should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the\\nway terms like \"family values\" take on special meaning from the\\ncurrent context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to\\nfigure out why \"family values\" should be used as a code word for\\nopposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I\\nthink Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was\\ninvolved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values\\nthat go along with the term \"Law\", any more than people who concerned\\nabout the \"family values\" movement are really opposed to family\\nvalues.\\n',\n",

              " '\\n\\nMcDonnell Douglas rolls out DC-X\\n\\n        HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. -- On a picture-perfect Southern\\nCalifornia day, McDonnell Douglas rolled out its DC-X rocket ship last\\nSaturday.  The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology\\ndemonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)\\nrocket ship.\\n\\n        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands\\nMissile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in\\nmid-June.\\n\\n        Although there wasn\\'t a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for\\nSSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60\\nmillion for the DC-X -- can\\'t itself afford to fund full development of a\\nfollow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for\\na sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government\\nagencies.\\n\\n        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for\\norbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent\\nchanges in SDI\\'s political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO\\nless of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as\\na step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.\\n\\n        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,\\nsaid Col.  Simon \"Pete\" Worden, SDIO\\'s deputy for technology.  But Worden\\ndeclined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the\\nprogram. \"I didn\\'t make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I\\nhave available to spend,\" he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell\\nDouglas Astronautics headquarters.\\n\\n        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program\\'s orbital\\nobjective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the \"better,\\nfaster, cheaper\" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes\\nthis philosophy can produce breakthroughs that \"leapfrog\" ahead of\\nevolutionary technology developments.\\n\\n        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a \"build a little, test a\\nlittle\" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said\\nthe program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --\\nshowed how today\\'s engineers could move beyond the \"miracles of our\\nparents\\' time.\"\\n\\n        \"The key is management,\" Worden said. \"SDIO had a very light hand\\non this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable.\"\\n\\n        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said\\nlean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be\\ncrucial. \"It\\'s essential we do not end up with a large management\\nstructure where the price goes up exponentially.\"\\n\\n        SDIO\\'s approach also won praise from two California members of the\\nHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee. \"This is the direction\\nwe\\'re going to have to go,\" said Rep.  George Brown, the committee\\'s\\nDemocratic chairman. \"Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren\\'t\\nsustainable....NASA hasn\\'t learned it yet.  SDIO has.\"\\n\\n        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown\\'s Republican colleague, went further.\\nJoking that \"a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,\"\\nRohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it\\nwere left to the civil space agency.\\n\\n        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell\\nDouglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged\\nrockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. \"Let\\'s not\\nbuild fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let\\'s build a spaceship!\"\\n\\n         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO\\'s sponsorship, he said the\\nprivate sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.\\n\\n        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its\\nC-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious\\nabout a large private secotro commitment. \"On very large ventures,\\ncompanies put in seed money,\" said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas\\'\\nsenior vice president for space systems. \"You need strong government\\ninvestments.\"\\n\\n        While the government and industry continue to differ on funding\\nfor the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to\\ndevelopment.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas\\nAircraft\\'s DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for\\nthe DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could\\neventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).\\n\\n        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will \"expand the envelope\"\\nof performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The\\nfirst tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle\\ntake-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to\\n5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000\\nfeet.\\n\\n        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final\\ntests will include a \"pitch-over\" manever that rotates the vehicle back\\ninto a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.\\n\\n        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles \"Pete\"\\nConrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.\\nNow a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles\\naircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated\\ncheck-out and access panels for easy maintainance.\\n\\n        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will\\nbecome a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the\\nPratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid\\nhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of\\nthrust\\n\\n        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model\\nhas a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on\\nthrottling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid\\nturnaround.\\n\\n        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ\\ntri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.\\nThe resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and\\nthen switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.\\n\\n        The mechanism for the teaming may already be in place.  Pratt has\\na technology agreement with NPO Energomash, the design bureau responsible\\nfor the tri-propellant and Energia cryogenic engines.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

If we take an\\nagnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit\\nsociety (with all the danger that this implies).

Remember from stellar evolution that \\nblack holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars,\\nM(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking\\nappoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time,\\nthey don\\'t live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any\\nof these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB\\'s) will be in the plane of the\\ngalaxy.  \\n        Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the\\nvarious satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either\\nPion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our\\ncatalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic\\ndistribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of\\nhomogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are\\nsampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE.\\nNot cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I\\nsuppose you are saying, \"Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the\\ndisk.\"  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an\\ninterplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out\\nto beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de\\ntect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here\\'s an \\nanalogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from\\nthe origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile\\naway sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his\\narbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different,\\nand you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe\\nfind a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.  \\n        I should throw in why halo, and corona models don\\'t work, also.  As I\\nsaid before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short\\ntimescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of\\nbehavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound\\nto the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources.\\nWhen you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk,\\nbut you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see\\nnot only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources \\nin the direction of the  galactic center.

I had the honor of\\ntaking the Bursts class with the person who has done the modeling of these\\ndifferent distributions, so we pretty much kicked around every possible\\ndistribution there was, and some VERY outrageous sources.

P. A1.\\n \\n EVIDENCE OF ADL SPY OPERATION SEIZED BY POLICE\\n \\n By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer\\n \\n SAN FRANCISCO -- Police on Thursday served search warrants on the\\n Anti-Defamation League here and in Los Angeles, seizing evidence of a\\n nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than\\n 950 political groups, newspapers and labor unions and as many as\\n 12,000 people.\\n \\n Describing the spy operation in great detail, San Francisco\\n authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how\\n operatives of the Anti-Defamation League searched through trash and\\n infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on Arab-American,\\n right-wing and what they called \"pinko\" organizations.\\n \\n Representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, a well-known\\n organization in the U.S. Jewish community dedicated to fighting\\n anti-Semitism, declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking\\n any laws.\\n \\n Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to\\n gather political intelligence in at least seven cities, including Los\\n Angeles and San Francisco.\\n \\n Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political\\n spectrum, including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan\\n Resistance, Operation Rescue, Greenpeace, the National Assn. for the\\n Advancement of Colored People, the United Farm Workers and the Jewish\\n Defense League.  Also on the list were Mills College, the board of\\n directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San\\n Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper.\\n \\n People who were subjects of the spy operation included former\\n Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey, jailed political extremist Lyndon H.\\n LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft, who\\n is based in South Africa.\\n \\n Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was\\n confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement\\n agencies.  They also alleged that data on some individuals and\\n organizations was sold separately to the South African government.\\n \\n In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from\\n police, the Anti-Defamation League could face a total of 48 felony\\n counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West\\n Coast spy, Roy Bullock, according to the affidavit filed to justify\\n the search warrant.\\n \\n The Anti-Defamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than\\n 25 years by funneling $550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I.\\n Hochman, who then paid Bullock, according to the documents released in\\n San Francisco.  Hochman, a former president of the Jewish Federation\\n Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state\\'s leading tax\\n attorneys, will be out of the city until late next week and could not\\n be reached for comment, his office said.\\n \\n Until 1990, Hochman, a former U.S. prosecutor, also was a member of a\\n panel appointed by then-Sen. Pete Wilson to secretly make initial\\n recommendations on new federal judges in California.  Hochman is a\\n former regional president of the Anti-Defamation League.\\n \\n The league, which initially cooperated with police, has denied\\n repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws.\\n League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an\\n employee and have said they simply traded information with police\\n departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes.\\n \\n But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday\\'s searches,\\n San Francisco police alleged that \"ADL employees were apparently less\\n than truthful\" in providing information during an earlier search\\n conducted without a warrant.\\n \\n David Lehrer, executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office, said\\n the organization has not violated the law.  \"There is nothing\\n nefarious about how we operate or what we have done,\" he said.  \"Our\\n record speaks for itself.\"\\n \\n The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret\\n fund used to pay for \"fact-finding operations.\"  Lehrer, according to\\n the documents, signed checks from the account under the name L.\\n Patterson.\\n \\n An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to\\n a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending\\n them directly to the Anti-Defamation League.\\n \\n Bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for\\n nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with\\n San Francisco police.  He said that he gathered names from many\\n sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as\\n \"Skins\" and \"Pinkos,\" but that did not necessarily mean that they were\\n under surveillance.\\n \\n \"I might never see or call up on 99% of them again,\" Bullock said.\\n \"And it doesn\\'t mean anything that they\\'re in the files.  It\\'s not a\\n threat to anyone\\'s civil rights that a name appears in my files under,\\n say, \\'Pinko.\\'\"\\n \\n In recent years, Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police\\n Officer Tom Gerard, who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he\\n was questioned by the FBI in the case.\\n \\n A former CIA employee, Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records\\n and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses,\\n vehicle registration, physical characteristics and drivers license\\n photographs.\\n \\n Using files gathered for the Anti-Defamation League, Gerard and\\n Bullock also provided information to the South African government,\\n receiving $16,000 over four years, the documents show.\\n \\n The file on Times staff writer Kraft, which was apparently sold to the\\n South African government, provides some insight into the hit-and-miss\\n nature of the spy operation.\\n \\n The file notes that Kraft\\'s articles \"appear frequently in The Times\\n and are well researched and written,\" but little else about the file\\n is accurate.  The brief entry confuses The Times\\' Kraft with another\\n Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong\\n Kraft\\'s physical description, photograph and other personal\\n information.\\n \\n Nevertheless, the documents provide illuminating details of how\\n Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations, from\\n skinheads to left-wing radicals, searching regularly through the trash\\n of target groups.  Using Anti-Defamation League funds, he also ran his\\n own paid informants under code names such as \"Scott\" and \"Scumbag.\"\\n \\n He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast,\\n exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies,\\n including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.\\n \\n It was Bullock\\'s work as a paid informant for the FBI -- while spying\\n on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and the South African\\n government -- that proved his undoing. The FBI learned that he was an\\n agent of a foreign government and began investigating, leading to the\\n probe of the Anti-Defamation League\\'s intelligence network.  The\\n Anti-Defamation League employed undercover operatives to gather\\n information in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington,\\n Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, according to the affidavit and\\n investigators.  Joining San Francisco police in searching league\\n offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of\\n San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax\\n Board.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to\\n cooperate with the investigation, was informed of the searches in Los\\n Angeles but not invited to participate.  Investigators suspect that\\n some confidential information in the Anti-Defamation League files may\\n have come from Los Angeles police officers.\\n \\n \\n \\n From Los Angeles Times, Saturday, April 10, 1993.  P. A23.\\n \\n ADL VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH SPY INVESTIGATION\\n \\n By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.\\n \\n SAN FRANCISCO -- The Anti-Defamation League defended its record as a\\n civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities\\n who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential\\n police information on citizens and groups.\\n \\n But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said that Anti-Defamation\\n League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many\\n felony counts of receiving confidential files, eavesdropping, tax\\n violations and conspiracy.\\n \\n Police have accused the Anti-Defamation League of not being truthful\\n about its spying operations, which collected information on more than\\n 12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political\\n spectrum.\\n \\n Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show\\n that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept\\n files on political figures.\\n \\n Even so, Smith suggested that if the Anti-Defamation League shut down\\n its spy operation, prosecutors would take that into account when\\n deciding what charges to file.\\n \\n In a statement released in Washington, National Director Abraham H.\\n Foxman described the ADL as \"a Jewish defense agency which has fought\\n to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80\\n years.\"\\n \\n Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on\\n extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing\\n information to police, journalists, academics, government officials\\n and the public.  It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain\\n information illegally, he said.\\n \\n \"Like other journalists, in order to protect the confidentiality and\\n physical safety of its sources, ADL will not comment on the nature or\\n identity of any source of information,\" Foxman said.\\n \\n The Anti-Defamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its\\n longtime employees, Roy Bullock, was anything more than \"a private\\n individual who is alleged to be an ADL \\'informant.\\'\"\\n \\n Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements\\n showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through\\n Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman.\\n \\n \"Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be\\n distanced from ADL,\" Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator.\\n Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment.\\n \\n Despite the Anti-Defamation League\\'s assertion that it will cooperate\\n with authorities, San Francisco police said the group did not turn\\n over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group\\'s\\n offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall.\\n \\n A second round of searches Thursday, this time with search warrants,\\n produced a vast quantity of records, primarily dealing with financial\\n transactions, Smith said.  Further searches may be necessary and it\\n will be at least a month before any charges are filed, he said.\\n \\n \"The investigation, of course, will go wherever the facts lead us,\"\\n the district attorney said.\\n --\\n Yigal Arens\\n USC/ISI                                                TV made me do it!\\n arens@isi.edu\\njs\\n\\n',\n",

The\\nprogram was described by these men as \"ineffective . . . not one person was\\nhealed.\"  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent\\nfeelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were\\ndriven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed \"reparative therapy.\"\\n\\nThe previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June\\n30, 1992 called \"The Ex-Ex-Gay\" by Robert Pela.\\n\\nSome personal thoughts:\\n\\nIt is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major\\nportion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among\\nits ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all\\nthey required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to\\nsave their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even\\nlater, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and\\nsegragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings.\\nToday\\'s scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is\\nstill coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind\\ncontrol, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than\\nGod sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt\\nthier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is \"physically\" forced\\nto stay in this \"reparative therapy\" but sheer social pressure is enough for\\nmany to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.\\n\\nAs an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution\\nagainst gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by\\nthe contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live,\\nnot by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven\\';t\\na clue what is in their heart.\\n\\nFor those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept them\\nplease contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG (Parents & Friends of Lesbians\\nAnd Gays) who will be more than happy to assist you.  This is a group of\\npeople comprised of Gays, Lesbians and Bisexuals, their parents and friends\\nwho have formed a support group for help and understanding.  Try talking to\\na parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some \"first-hand\" real life and\\nloving understanding.  God\\'s love and understanding for Gay people is no\\nless abundant.\\n\\nThank you.\\nPAX\\n',\n",

              " '\\n\\nThe primary problem in human nature is a \"fragmentation of being.\"\\nHumans are in a state of tension, a tension of opposites. Good and\\nevil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.\\n\\nThe Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of\\nbeing. The warring opposites within us are a product of man\\'s\\nrebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of\\nthe Scriptures.\\n\\nMan was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words\\nof St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was\\nthat God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the\\nEastern Orthodox Church, this is called \"theosis,\" or \"deification.\"\\n\\nOne can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul,\\nand body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture\\nof the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs\\nwas a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the\\nCreator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God,\\ntheir natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly\\nirreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in\\ntheir lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This\\nis symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.\\n\\nThe beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it\\nwere to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil,\\nits paradisiac state would also be destroyed.\\n\\nWas it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of\\ninnocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining\\nof self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His\\nmasterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?\\n\\nGod must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral\\nvalue, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There\\nis no other way to achieve union with God.\\n\\nJesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities.\\nHe was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites,\\nand making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God,\\nnot in His essence, but in His energies.\\n\\nThe opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes it\\nwith the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24. And he follows with the\\nanswer to his dilemma in vs 25.\\n\\n                                 Mark\\n\\n',\n",

              " '\\n\\nWho wants to look through the bars at some reactionary Liberal conspiracy-\\ntheory idiots and see how they rant and rave at the erosion of their populist \\nsupport?  This is very typical of the elitist Liberal attitude that The People \\nare incapable of thinking for themselves.  This elitist attitude will be the\\neventual undoing of the arrogant liberal tide sweeping America, as The People\\nbegin to realize more and more that they are being treated like errant children\\nand robbed of their freedoms by a bunch of Utopian arrogent socialist jerks.\\n\\n\\nIn article 167077 in talk.politics.misc, New Liberation News Service \\n<nlns@igc.apc.org> writes:\\n\\n>Subject: NLNS: Fascism with a Friendly Face\\n>Lines: 164\\n\\n>From: New Liberation News Service <nlns>\\n>Subject: NLNS: Fascism with a Friendly Face\\n\\n>/* Written  8:33 pm  Apr 14, 1993 by nlns@igc.apc.org in igc:nlns.news */\\n>/* ---------- \"NLNS Packet 3.11 *** 4-14-93\" ---------- */\\n\\n>Fascism with a Friendly Face: Does Rush Limbaugh Remind You of \\n>Anyone?\\n>Daevid Bornhuetter-Machen, The Madison Edge\\n\\n>\"The main difference between Adolf Hitler and Rush Limbaugh is that \\n>Hitler was original and showed initiative.\" \\n>--Mort Sahl on The Tom Snyder Radio Show, ABC Radio Network, \\n>October 27, 1992.\\n\\nAlthough I find myself often disagreeing with the populist rationale\\nof Mr. Limbaugh, I find him entertaining and I often agree with his \\nconclusions.  The fact that he sends liberal reactionaries like these\\nidiots through the roof makes him all the more entertaining.\\n\\n\\n\\n>(NLNS)--Believe it or not, I was planning this comparative review of \\n>Mein Kampf and Limbaugh\\'s transcribed rant, The Way Things Ought to \\n>Be before Sahl issued his comparative review. As usual, Sahl\\'s was \\n>independent and sharp as a scalpel.\\n>        My effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort\\'s. At \\n>least it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I\\'d mention the \\n>idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for \\n>delivery.\\n>        Those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the \\n>most peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are \\n>noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with \\n>passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in \\n>fact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost \\n>identical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German \\n>election). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and \\n>enthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their \\n>ideological quilt.\\n\\nActually, I find Limbaugh\\'s oratory less than sizzling and his debating\\nskills sometimes lacking, even though his conclusions are often correct.\\n\\nI would suggest that a bankrupt leftist ideology that hopes to use concentrated \\npolitical power and a loaded gun to force everyone to do the \"right\" things\\n(where \"right\" is defined by the elitist academics who lead the movement)\\nis showing an acute case of \"myopic social perspective\", not to mention\\narrogance and utter stupidity.\\n\\nLimbaugh is certainly far from perfect, but his opponents in the established\\nbody politic and the media are the ones arguing for Federal control of\\nvirtually all aspects of the lives of the Citizenry, and for the elimination\\nof local control over Affairs Public.  \\n\\nPerhaps Limbaugh has a following because The People are tired of being treated \\nlike errant children by a self-important group of arrogant controlling myopic \\npeople who have no understanding of how life operates outside of the \"oughta-be\\'s\"\\ninside their own hopelessly closed minds.\\n\\n\\n\\n>        The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening \\n>pages of both books. Hitler\\'s example is when, on page 5, he claims the \\n>German nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway \\n>line between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923) \\n>was \"betrayed to France by a representative of his government\" when \\n>there has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.\\n>        In fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as \\n>the Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost \\n>succeeded. \\n\\nOK, let us take your word for that and work with it.  A nice specific\\nincident.\\n\\n\\n\\n>Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic \\n>claim in his introduction that \"in a school or during a commencement \\n>ceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional.\" Of \\n>course, it\\'s not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of \\n>God against an individual\\'s will that\\'s unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is \\n>too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.\\n\\nHmmm, \"Congress shall pass no law regarding an establishment of religion,\\nnor prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\"  Liberal translation: \"the\\nfederal government (as long as it is run by Liberals) may force local\\nschool districts to include certain iconic content in Christmas displays,\\nwhile prohibiting others.\"\\n\\nI think Limbaugh has you on this one.  It seems to me that he is arguing\\nfor LESS imposition of the federal government into religion.\\n\\nNice job on the specificity of that one, too.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Analysis of historical/modern communication media deleted] \\n\\n>        But, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some \\n>cloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of \\n>their propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these \\n>days.)\\n>        Mort might not know exactly who Rush\\'s equivalent of Rodolf \\n>Hess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of \\n>ABC radio and now Limbaugh\\'s partner in EFM Media, the radio \\n>program\\'s production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk \\n>show, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He \\n>knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows \\n>that Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the \\n>opportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh \\n>earns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it\\'s almost worthy of a \\n>RICO indictment.\\n\\nAh yes, it is a conspiracy of profound proportions.  Methinks that you\\nmay be a bit resentful of Mr. Limbaugh\\'s success because you attribute it\\nprimarily to luck (how, after all, could anyone with profound differences\\nof opinion from yourself have become successful without the operation of\\nconspiracy or blind luck!)  Do you feel this same level of knee-jerk\\nresentment against lottery winners, or do you congratulate them on their\\ngood fortune?\\n\\n\\n\\n>        On questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of \\n>material in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler\\'s venom. For \\n>example:\\n\\nThis should be great fun, since it is the Liberal movement in America\\nthat is pushing the hardest for centralized fascist control of The People\\nand business (government/business \\'partnership\\' indeed), and Mr. Limbaugh \\nis the populist nemesis of that movement.\\n\\nI have read Mr. Limbaugh\\'s book, and although it was not the most literary\\npiece I have read in recent memory it certainly did not contain \"venom\"\\nat all, let alone \"venom\" comparable to an individual who callously murdered\\nmillions out of racism.\\n\\n\\n\\n>On Their Own Qualifications to Control Society\\n>        Hitler: \"Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who \\n>individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly \\n>perhaps understand it, one man [author\\'s emphasis] must step forward in \\n>order to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of \\n>imagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight \\n>for their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of \\n>thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises\" \\n>(page 577).\\n\\nA very serious tone in that oratory.\\n\\n\\n\\n>        Limbaugh: \"Who needs the media when they\\'ve got me? ... The \\n>show is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase \"with half my \\n>brain tied behind my back to make it even\"] denotes the egress of mental \\n>aptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree \\n>with me ... It might take four or five years, but I\\'m convinced The Media \\n>will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking \\n>and screaming all the way.\" (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)\\n\\nYou neglect to mention that Mr. Limbaugh (have you ever listened to his show, \\nBTW?) continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather\\nthan blindly following any media icon, himself included.  You yourself mention \\nthat he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions.\\nHe also adopts a rather satirical approach, and presumes his audience to be\\nintelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness (and he says as much).\\nThis is in contrast to the average mass-media show, in which the audience is\\ntreated as society\\'s intellectual lowest common denominator.\\n\\nI am sure that Adolf Hitler was a master of satire; I am sure he was just\\nkidding when he said that the Jews were the cause of Germany\\'s problems and\\nneeded to be exterminated.\\n\\n\\n\\n>On Religion as the Basis of a Nation\\n>        Hitler: \"In this world human culture and civilization are \\n>inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his \\n>decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without \\n>culture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord \\n>sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the \\n>expulsion from Paradise.\" (Page 581.)\\n\\nThis is not religion, it is clearly a perverse worship of race.  Since\\nChrist was a Jew, it seems quite unlikely that Hitler\\'s characterization of\\nthe Aryan as \"the highest image of the Lord\" fits with Christian doctrine.\\n\\n\\n\\n>        Limbaugh: \"America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... \\n>But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or \\n>ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a \\n>charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools \\n>for the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of \\n>American education has declined ever since?\" (pages 274-5.)\\n\\nPrivate religious schools have a vastly better record of success than\\npublicly funded schools.  American history is indeed primarily Judeo-\\nChristian.  I suppose that Mr. Limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalent\\nto Adolf Hitler worshiping the Aryan race.  I think you might be reaching\\njust a wee bit here.\\n\\n\\n\\n>On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse\\n>        Hitler: \"The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... \\n>One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and \\n>theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... \\n>Theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays \\n>must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the \\n>service of a moral idea of State and culture.\" (pages 346 and 348.)\\n\\nDefinite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment\\nindustry here.\\n\\n\\n>        Limbaugh: \"Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that \\n>Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people \\n>who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality \\n>and monagamy. They disparage American heroes.\" (page 254.)\\n\\nJust a guess here, but I don\\'t think that Mr. Limbaugh would advocate\\ngovernment control of Hollywood.  You should perhaps call his radio show\\nto confirm this.  I believe this is more a criticism of Hollywood and the\\ndepraved moral values it espouses, not an advocation of government control \\nof Hollywood.\\n\\n90\\'s Liberals, on the other hand, want to have complete government control \\nof our school systems, so that the government can teach The People at an\\nearly age the \"right\" way to view religion and morality.  I believe Mr. \\nLimbaugh is against this, as his satirical use of the \"young heads full\\nof mush\" hyperbole indicates.\\n\\n\\n\\n>On the News Meida\\n>        Hitler: \"The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of \\n>gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass \\n>by in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it\\'s task is only to break the \\n>people\\'s folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of \\n>slavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews.\" (Page 331.)\\n\\nPretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here, with an implicit plea for\\ngovernment power to be used to break up the conspiracy.\\n\\n\\n\\n>        Limbaugh: \"Elements of The Media have jumped on the \\n>bandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been \\n>replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During \\n>the Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global \\n>network. We can\\'t take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don\\'t \\n>realize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that \\n>therefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided \\n>and, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania.\" (pages 270 and 268.)\\n\\nIndication here that \"Elements of the Media\" (since career is a self-selected\\ncategorization, perhaps an inferred \\'larger percentage than represented in\\nthe populace at large\\') has a leftist bias.  Doesn\\'t sound too unreasonable.\\nNo insinuation that CNN should not report in an objective fashion, only\\nthat for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in the\\nsituation is disingenuous to megalomaniacal.\\n\\nYou may disagree, and it may well be exagerrated, but it is not an unreasonable \\nopinion; and Mr. Limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his \\naudience knows that these are his opinions, unlike most other reporting that \\npurports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree \\nor other, in a statistical sense, reflect the biases of the reporters.  Who \\nis being disingenuous here, Mr. Shaw or Mr. Limbaugh?\\n\\nAgain, you should ask Mr. Limbaugh himself, but I expect that he would\\noppose government control of the media.\\n\\n\\n\\n>*     *     *\\n        \\n>To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but \\n>ultimately too depressing to take in one reading.\\n\\nIt is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome Liberal arrogance.\\nLiberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting people\\nwho disagree with them.  Why don\\'t you challenge conservative ideology\\non an intellectual level rather than engaging in ludicrous comparisons?\\nPerhaps the underpinnings of your ideology are intellectual only in that\\nthey exist in your mind, not the real world.\\n\\n\\n\\n>        After putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that \\n>haunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened \\n>Germans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed \\n>Germans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s, \\n>Rush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to \\n>depressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American \\n>radical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the \\n>Reagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for \\n>The Fascist States of America.\\n\\nPerhaps there are a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve\\nRush Limbaugh as a hate-monger, but in my experience he has been spreading\\nlaughter at the ludicrous self-importance of the Left, not hatred.\\n\\nAs to Mr. Bush, you may be correct about his fascist economic leanings.\\nMr. Reagan, on the other hand, did his best to reverse the fascist trend\\nof government involvement in business.  Mr. Clinton is increasing fascism\\nin America through \"business/government partnership\" and increased levels\\nof taxation.  Perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classes\\nin grade school.\\n\\n\\n\\n>        And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the \\n>radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. One can only \\n>wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on.\\n\\nHmmm.  Seems to me that Limbaugh is not in any way comparable to Hitler\\nbecause he has not murdered six million Jews and many, many others out of\\nracism.  I come from a mixed-race family, so I am quite well attuned to\\nracism; I don\\'t hear any coming from Rush Limbaugh.  The only place I hear \\nracism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the Liberal \\nLeft.\\n\\nThe Liberal Left is the movement I see trying to get America hooked\\non the opiates of Socialized Medicine, Socialized Transportation, Socialized\\nEducation, etc.  The Left already has America hopelessly addicted to \\nthat Liberal drug, the Social Security Chain Letter.  It is quite clear\\nto me that while the Hitler analogy does not really apply to either Rush \\nLimbaugh or William Jefferson Clinton, if one of the two is closer than \\nthe other it is clearly the Fascist Clinton.\\n\\n\\n>The Madison Edge can be reached at PO Box 845, Madison, WI 53701-\\n>0845; (608) 255-4460.\\n>\\n>--- 30 ---\\n\\nThis is the same address as \"Idiots Anonymous\", isn\\'t it?\\n\\n\\nMatt Freivald\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLiBORGalism:\\n             THINKING IS IRRELEVANT.

He reiterated the U.S. \\nposition, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the \\nKuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa\\'s \\ncommitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a \\nconstructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to \\nhear that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq \\nfor the last few days, I\\'m a little confused.  What is the U.S. \\npolicy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s the same policy that Secretary \\nChristopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have \\nreiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance \\nwith all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     throwing it out further that if Iraq complies, \\nSaddam can\\'t stay in office?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that\\'s -- our \\njudgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with \\nthe resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that \\nwe expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will \\ncontinue to demand it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And are you concerned the Iran will become the \\ndominant power in the area --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also \\nspoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect \\nfull Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping \\nsupport of terrorism.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That\\'s a very glib statement that he won\\'t stay in \\npower if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you \\nbase that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not \\ncomplying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the \\nrights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is \\nnot fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.  \\nHe is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding \\narmaments.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, when do you think that if he did comply he \\nwould be out of power?\\n\\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on \\nthe repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make \\nit more difficult for him to stay in power.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, back on the stimulus package, why is it \\nthat you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure \\npolitics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence \\ndo you have that they just don\\'t have a genuine idealogical \\ndifference with you that\\'s in good faith?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times \\nin the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the \\nfight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now \\nseek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, in regards to that, some of the moderate \\nRepublicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to \\nthem during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had \\none, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate \\nRepublicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and \\nthinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some -\\n-\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I\\'m not sure that it\\'s true \\nthat there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the \\nRepublican leadership on at least two occasions before the \\nintroduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate \\nRepublican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are \\ncontinually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who \\nhave an interest in the President\\'s package.  We are interested in \\nwhat they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is \\nimportant, and we\\'re going to continue to fight for it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats \\nalone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it \\nthrough?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is \\nno question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can \\nfrustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.  \\nYou only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going \\nand to stop any action, and that\\'s what the Republicans are doing.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     going to rethink the way you attempt to get \\nother things passed as you go through this process for the rest of \\nthe summer?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     work with Republicans and try to woo some \\nRepublicans into your camp?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we\\'re going to continue to \\nlook for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the \\nPresident\\'s intiatives?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But on this one -- how are you going to do it \\ndifferently than you did it on this one because on this one you \\nreally did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear \\nthat it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and \\ncould get it through and you really didn\\'t need Republican votes?  \\nAre you going to take a different tack when you have to go for \\nparticular votes?  When you have to go through --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can\\'t see into the future and \\nunderstand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the \\nPresident\\'s going to continue to reach out when he can.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You don\\'t have any regrets then about the way you \\nhave handled it up to now and you don\\'t plan any changes in your \\napproach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this \\nexperience?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like \\nhis package passed as quickly as possible and he\\'s going to continue \\nto press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans, \\nthere\\'s not question about that.  And we\\'ll continue to reason with \\nthem and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this \\ncase the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around \\na plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  They\\'re being denied any other legislative means of \\nputting their proposals forward.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they\\'re being --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     any ideas.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being \\ndefeated; I don\\'t know that they\\'re being denied.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     to present them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s not exactly true.  I mean \\nthey get the votes --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     that theirs can be passed though by the \\nparliamentary rules under which they\\'re playing.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in \\nsupport all the way around, no, that\\'s not exactly true.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration \\nbacking any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we\\'re pressing for \\nIraqi compliance.  I don\\'t know if we can get into the business of \\ngrooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at \\nsome levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don\\'t know  about \\nanything recently.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the \\nPresident\\'s best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be \\nsome kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the \\nPresident, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider \\nsomething like that, or any other kind of intervention there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President \\nappointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a \\nspecial envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around \\nthe California economic situation, including the situation in Los \\nAngeles.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles \\nby the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary, \\nMr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD \\nSecretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits \\nby Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I \\nwouldn\\'t rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to \\nCalifornia.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is \\nconcerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy \\ndecisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities \\nwhich help prevent disturbances.  But we\\'re going to continue to \\nwatch it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also \\nsupposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a \\ngroup of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball \\nmanagement.  Does the President have a position on that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received \\ncorrespondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson \\nhas also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.  \\nHe clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in \\nbaseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the \\nPresident intends to continue to go to the ball game.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he going to say anything about it today, or see \\nReverend Jackson while he\\'s out there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if he is going to see \\nthem, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has \\nraised some serious questions, and it\\'s something that, as I said, \\neven though there has been progress, it\\'s clearly not enough.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball \\ngame?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not sure about that.  I believe \\nthe characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an \\ninformational pickett.  I don\\'t know that he asked him not to go to \\nthe ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining \\nhis concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the \\nPresident read it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the \\nmanaging partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be \\nthere, and is he going to meet with the President?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is the Mubarak schedule?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is \\ncoming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a \\nlunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice \\nPresident Gore.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And joint statements tomorrow --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end, \\nyes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did \\nwarn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist \\nactivities?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times, \\nI mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been \\ngeneral conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a \\nlong period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I \\nmean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there \\nwas no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.  \\nThe President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also \\nreiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians, \\napparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who, \\nforgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at \\nthe moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in \\ntheir attempts to get some kind of action.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don\\'t know if I would \\nagree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did \\nsay that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a \\nnetwork in the United States and upon which we took appropriate \\naction.  But there was no specific information on this specific \\noperation at all.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So, the White House doesn\\'t feel that any of the \\nlaw enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have \\nreceived this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in \\nnot pursuing some kind of --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What\\'s next with Serbia?  It got only a passing \\nmention in the news conference yesterday --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn\\'t get to ask your \\nquestion.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted \\naction between the two countries?  And even if there wasn\\'t, what \\ndoes the U.S. do next?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going \\nto move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our \\nallies on a sanctions resolution and we\\'ll continue to look for ways \\nto press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an \\nagreement.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, why do you think sanctions is still an \\noption?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the \\nleadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait \\nyou out and even the administration officials we had in the other day \\nsaid there\\'s no evidence that they\\'re going to have an effect any \\ntime soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When \\ndoes no mean no and you have to do something different?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something \\ndifferent.  We\\'re moving forward on further sanctions through the \\nU.N. and those discussions will continue.  We\\'re going to continue to \\ntry and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every \\nopportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo? \\nMR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something \\nthat is under consideration.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham\\'s \\ncondition, how he\\'s doing?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As far as I know nothing\\'s changed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s a little unclear.  I think \\nwe\\'ll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning \\nafter the Mubarak visit.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he going somewhere for Easter?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What more can you tell us about the additional aid \\nto Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He\\'s going to be consulting with \\nthe Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.  \\nI know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their \\ndelegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the \\nRussians this week and those consultations will continue over the \\nnext several weeks.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude \\nof the one announced Sunday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not going to discuss the \\nmagnitude.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where \\ndo you stand on that --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As the President said yesterday, \\nhe\\'s going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week \\nand reviewing it.  He believes -- he\\'s going to try and get it this \\nweek and he\\'s going to review the list, and we\\'re going to take a \\nhard look at it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But they\\'re making it up?  I mean it\\'s no White \\nHouse involvement, Congress is compiling this list?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he\\'s going to talk to the \\ncongressional leaders about compiling the list but I\\'m certain we\\'ll \\nbe able to get our own researchers working as well.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, isn\\'t lifting the arms embargo more of a \\nprobability than a possibility?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s something that\\'s under \\ndiscussion.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Secretary Christopher has said that it\\'s a matter \\nof time and -- for months before that happens.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it\\'s \\nsomething that the President is reviewing.  Right now we\\'re working \\nwith our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we\\'ll \\ncontinue to review other matters.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, can you tell us anything about the schedule \\nthis week?  Any travel?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They just asked about that.  I \\ndon\\'t have anything more beyond tomorrow\\'s visit with Mubarak right \\nnow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are there consultations, George, with any Jewish \\nAmerican organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR.

To assist cooling\\nand the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the\\nhot pipes.

But they have been systematically \\n          IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years! \\n\\n               The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \\n          calls the \"Reciprocal System\", is built on two fundamental \\n          postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of \\n          space and time: \\n    \\n               (1) \"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \\n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \\n          UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\" \\n    \\n               (2) \"The physical universe conforms to the relations of \\n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are \\n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\" \\n    \\n               From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE \\n          Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of \\n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-\\n          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward \\n          SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light \\n          (which Larson called \"UNIT VELOCITY\" and \"THE NATURAL \\n          DATUM\"). \\n      \\n               At each step in the development, Larson was able to \\n          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the \\n          REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles \\n          [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star \\n          clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white \\n          dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET \\n          DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY \\n          BURSTS). \\n          \\n               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, \\n          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-\\n          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility \\n          and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of \\n          matter. \\n\\n               All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy \\n          complex mathematics, in his books. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          BOOKS of Dewey B.

Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the \\n          organization that was started to promote Larson\\'s Theory.  \\n          They have other related publications, including the quarterly \\n          journal \"RECIPROCITY\". \\n\\n          \\n\\n          Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s Background\\n    \\n               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer \\n          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he \\n          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in \\n          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He \\n          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE \\n          chemical properties based only on the elements used. \\n    \\n               Larson\\'s lack of a fancy \"PH.D.\" degree might be one \\n          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is \\n          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider \\n          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same \\n          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX \\n          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, \\n          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC \\n          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. \\n     \\n               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally \\n          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  \\n          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER \\n          researchers\\' experimental and observational data.  And in \\n          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. \\n    \\n               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX \\n          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking \\n          for a \"unified field theory\" that works, but have been \\n          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! \\n    \\n               \"Modern physics\" does NOT explain the physical universe \\n          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson\\'s books are FULL of \\n          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who \\n          agree.  And remember that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\", \\n          \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED \\n          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. \\n    \\n    \\n               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, \\n          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson\\'s Theory, and was (or \\n          still is) President of Larson\\'s organization, \"THE \\n          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\", and Editor of \\n          their quarterly Journal \"RECIPROCITY\".  He moved to \\n          Minneapolis after retiring. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          \"Super Collider\" BOONDOGGLE!\\n          \\n               I am AGAINST contruction of the \"Superconducting Super \\n          Collider\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS \\n          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \"scientific\" \\n          value. \\n    \\n               Most physicists don\\'t realize it, but, according to the \\n          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY \\n          particles (\"mesons\", \"hyperons\", ALLEGED \"quarks\", etc.) \\n          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, \\n          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are \\n          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly \\n          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible \\n          with their environment. \\n    \\n               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a \\n          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not \\n          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE \\n          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! \\n    \\n               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 \\n          BILLION cost?!!  Don\\'t we have much more important uses for \\n          this WASTED money?! \\n    \\n     \\n               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed \\n          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some \\n          kind of \"fire ants\" eating the insulation off underground \\n          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water \\n          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of \\n          the \"Supercollider\"?! \\n    \\n          \\n               Naming the \"Super Collider\" after Ronald Reagon, as \\n          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be \\n          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. \\n      \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter\\n          \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of \\n          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more \\n          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the \\n          photons of which they are made, in relation to the \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, \\n          which Larson calls \"Unit Velocity\" and the \"Natural Datum\". \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, a positron is actually a particle of \\n          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, \\n          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their \\n          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each \\n          other. \\n      \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical \\n          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension \\n          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our \\n          MATERIAL half. \\n       \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Relativity\\n          \\n               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury \\n          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the \\n          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this \\n          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational \\n          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, \\n          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to \\n          help \"prove\" Einstein\\'s \"General Theory of Relativity\". \\n    \\n               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results \\n          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \"General Relativity\" can, by \\n          INSTEAD using \"SPECIAL Relativity\".  In one or more of his \\n          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH \\n          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. \\n    \\n               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \"General Relativity\" as another \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \"Special \\n          Relativity\", including the parts about \"mass increases\" near \\n          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on \\n          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than \\n          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, \\n          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead \\n          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured \\n          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one \\n          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low \\n          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are \\n          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and \\n          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. \\n          [Larson often used the term \"COORDINATE TIME\" when writing \\n          about this.] \\n    \\n     \\n               In regard to \"mass increases\", it has been PROVEN in \\n          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near \\n          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is \\n          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists \\n          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson\\'s Theory, \\n          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is \\n          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS \\n          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  \\n          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward \\n          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of \\n          the so-called \"Big Bang\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL \\n          FANTASY). \\n    \\n                                    \\n          \\n          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\n\\n               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \"THE UNIVERSE \\n          OF MOTION\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific \\n          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 \\n          pages, indexed, hardcover. \\n    \\n               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL \\n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that \\n          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. \\n    \\n               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical \\n          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and \\n          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of \\n          the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-\\n          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white \\n          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. \\n    \\n               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL \\n          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with \\n          OPEN MINDS! \\n    \\n               The following is an example of his Theory\\'s success: \\n          In his first book in 1959, \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL \\n          UNIVERSE\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING \\n          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding \\n          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson\\'s \\n          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he \\n          had an immediate related explanation for them also. \\n    \\n\\n \\n          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS\\n\\n               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching \\n          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were \\n          originally thought to originate from \"neutron stars\" in the \\n          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in \\n          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions \\n          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT \\n          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of \\n          directional coincidence). \\n    \\n               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of \\n          his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", published in 1984, the \\n          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the \\n          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls \\n          the \"Cosmic Sector\".  Because of the relationship between the \\n          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and \\n          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can \\n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at \\n          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do \\n          not correspond with known objects, and come from all \\n          directions uniformly.) \\n    \\n               I wonder how close to us in space a source location \\n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \\n          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to \\n          stop it! \\n    \\n               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which \\n          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were \\n          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation\\n          \\n               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the \\n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox \\n          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory \\n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \\n    \\n               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY \\n          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of \\n          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey \\n          B. Larson. \\n    \\n               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is \\n          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" \\n          and in some of his other books. \\n    \\n               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate \\n          energy by \"fusion\".  A small fraction comes from slow \\n          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE \\n          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each \\n          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the \\n          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star\\'s internal \\n          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and \\n          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually \\n          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \\n          lighter elements. \\n    \\n               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the \\n          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I \\n          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron \\n          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms \\n          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some \\n          of his books [better than I can]. \\n    \\n               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the \\n          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less \\n          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center \\n          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to \\n          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The \\n          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and \\n          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN \\n          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. \\n    \\n               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall \\n          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown \\n          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The \\n          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a \\n          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward \\n          the \"MAIN SEQUENCE\" from opposite directions on the H-R \\n          Diagram. \\n    \\n               The chances of the two masses falling back into the \\n          exact same location in space, making a single lone star \\n          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY \\n          system, orbiting each other. \\n     \\n               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE \\n          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the \\n          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown \\n          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \"degenerate matter\", \"neutron \\n          stars\", \"black holes\", etc.. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation\\n\\n               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the \\n          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single \\n          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \"mini\" white dwarf \\n          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably \\n          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected \\n          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! \\n      \\n               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all \\n          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive \\n          his own version of Bode\\'s Law. \\n          \\n\\n\\n          \"Black Hole\" FANTASY!\\n\\n               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently \\n          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \"black \\n          holes\" merging together into a SINGLE \"black hole\", and \\n          concluded that the new \"black hole\" would have MORE MASS than \\n          the sum of the two original \"black holes\". \\n    \\n               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED \\n          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \"black \\n          holes\", etc.! \\n    \\n               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s books about \\n          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe, especially his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", it is \\n          clear to me that \"black holes\" are NOTHING more than \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is \\n          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \"black \\n          hole\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want \\n          to \"prove\" their theory. \\n    \\n    \\n               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is \\n          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and \\n          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking\\'s severe physical \\n          problem somehow makes him \"wiser\".  It does NOT! \\n    \\n               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread \\n          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson\\'s \\n          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of \\n          Unified Science). \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION\\n\\n               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection \\n          with UFO\\'s and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to \\n          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. \\n    \\n               I found a possible clue about why they might work on \\n          pages 112-113 of the book \"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\", by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of \\n          Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe.  I quote one paragraph: \\n    \\n               \"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development \\n          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally \\n          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  \\n          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It \\n          was brought out in Volume I [Larson\\'s book \"NOTHING BUT \\n          MOTION\"] that there are physical processes in operation which \\n          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, \\n          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in \\n          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities \\n          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are \\n          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of \\n          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the \\n          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged \\n          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension \\n          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, \\n          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open \\n          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently \\n          in the same location with respect to the natural reference \\n          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the \\n          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, \\n          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by \\n          the progression of the natural reference system.  All \\n          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons \\n          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  \\n          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, \\n          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The \\n          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth \\n          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\" \\n          \\n               Note that in Larson\\'s Theory, UNcharged electrons are \\n          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a \\n          particular frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) spinning \\n          around one axis at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate).  \\n          (\"Unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, \\n          according to Larson\\'s Theory.)  [I might have the \"above\" and \\n          \"below\" labels mixed up.] \\n    \\n               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-\\n          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of \\n          light! \\n    \\n               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION \\n          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these \\n          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a \\n          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to \\n          achieve propulsion. (In Larson\\'s Theory, an electrical charge \\n          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular \\n          frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) superimposed on the \\n          rotation of the particle.) \\n      \\n               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to \\n          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is \\n          generated in clouds. \\n\\n\\n\\n          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics\\n\\n               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has \\n          been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in \\n          his first book \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\". \\n    \\n               It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan, \\n          and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call \\n          \"science\" (or \"physics\", or \"astronomy\", etc.), as well as \\n          the \"scientific\" literature and the \"education\" systems, to \\n          TOTALLY IGNORE Larson\\'s Theory has they have. \\n    \\n               Larson\\'s Theory has excellent explanations for many \\n          things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such \\n          as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars. \\n    \\n               Larson\\'s Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY \\n          discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals, \\n          in the U.S. and elsewhere.

Also consider the 90VAC+ @20Hz that is forced on ring\\nand tip when the phone's supposed to ring!  Even with a simple zener\\nand LED setup, you might end up with some carbon real quick.

Please spread the word!  Here's some\\ninformation about the events, and then a couple of messages from Jay\\nGoguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to\\nlearn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus.  He might also have\\nsome money available...\\n\\nJohn Spencer, 1993/04/21\\n\\nIapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturn's rings and Saturn\\nitself on 1993/05/01-02 (18:27-13:43 UT) and again on 1993/07/20-21,\\n(21:16-09:38 UT).

Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen from\\nIapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about\\nthe rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomy\\nand Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odell\\nof Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my\\nattention.\\n\\nTHERMAL OBSERVATIONS?\\n\\nJay Goguen (jdg@scn5.Jpl.Nasa.Gov) writes:\\n\\n  To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July\\n  disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,\\n  etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,\\n  except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3\\n  airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with\\n  a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something\\n  to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.\\n\\n  Jay\\n\\nand again:\\n\\n  please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet\\n  disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would\\n  be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and\\n  getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a\\n  good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't\\n  think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are\\n  well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One\\n  possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.\\n\\njay\\n\\n     ___    _____     ___\\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\\\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\\n    | | | |  __ \\\\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\\n\\n\",\n",

Smith) writes:\\n \\n># #Are you saying that:\\n># \\n># #(1) People voted for Hitler, and he became Reich Chancellor, in good\\n># #part because he used bully boys to attack communists,\\n \\n># Hitler did not become become Reich Chancellor because people voted for\\n># him. I'm not sure if you meant to imply that or not, but I just thought\\n># I'd bring that up.\\n\\n>Hitler became Chancellor because people voted for his political\\n>party.  That's not a huge difference in a parliamentary system.\\n\\nYour statement is a common misconception, but it just isn't true. In the\\nGerman Weimar system, the Chancellor was not necessarily the leader of the\\nlargest Reichstag party; the Chancellor was appointed by the President and\\ngenerally was the leader of a coalition of parties who could form an effective\\nmajority in the Reichstag. Beyond that, the implication that Hitler rose to\\nthe Chancellorship because a majority of Germans wanted Nazi rule is false\\nas well. Before President Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor in January\\n1933, the German people did not show a particular desire to be led either by\\nHitler or by the Nazi party. These are the results of the March 1932 election\\nfor President, the closest Hitler ever came to direct election: Hindenburg\\n49.6%, Hitler 30.1%, Thaelmann 13.2%, Duesterberg 6.8%. In the runoff election\\nin April the results were: Hindenburg 53%, Hitler 36.8%, Thaelmann 10.2%.\\nSo we can see that Hitler personally was supported by only about a third of\\nGerman voters.\\n\\nSimilarly, the Nazi party never received more than 37% of the vote in\\nReichstag elections. That occurred in July 1932. In the November 1932 election\\nthe Nazis *lost* two million votes and 34 seats, down from 230 to 196 out of\\nthe 608 in the Reichstag. Comparitively, the Socialists had 121 and the\\nCommunists 100. The Communists had gained 11 seats, and the German National\\nparty, which had supported the previous government, had picked up a million\\nof the Nazis' lost votes to gain 15 seats (up to 52). I think the other large\\nparty was the Catholic Center party (I don't know how many seats they had but\\nI think they were declining), and there were numerous other small parties.\\nThus the Nazi vote was on the decline at the time Hitler was appointed\\nChancellor.\\n\\nWhat brought Hitler to power was *not* the demand of the German people for\\nHitler or the Nazis to run things, but the inability of the other parties to\\nput their differences behind them in favor of forming an effective government\\nfor the country. Germany did not have an enduring democratic tradition, and\\ntheir parliamentary system lacked effective center parties that favored the\\ninterests of the majority of the population. Instead what they had was a\\nnumber of small parties who were unable to put aside their own specific\\nobjectives in order to combine against the Nazis, who were out to end the\\ndemocratic process. In fact, part of the problem was that some of the other\\nparties with substantial representation, like the Communists, were also\\nout to end the democratic process, but with different results in mind, and\\ngenerally didn't mind seeing parliamentary democracy go under.\\n\\nGermany had already had a non-Nazi Chancellor with a majority coalition\\nfor five months while the Nazis had been the largest Reichstag party, and\\nthere certainly was no danger of a revolution in favor of the Nazis.\\nIf anything the Nazis were starting to get desperate because they had failed\\nto get enough support to make Hitler President and their popular vote had\\nbegun to decline.\\n\\nHitler was not Hindenburg's first choice to be Chancellor, not even his\\nsecond choice. First, von Papen had been Chancellor since June 1932. After\\nthe November election when the Nazis *lost* seats, Hindenburg first prevailed\\non von Papen to remain as Chancellor. But there were intrigues behind his back\\nand support for him was lacking. So then Hindenburg turned to von Schleicher,\\nwho became Chancellor for two months. Eventually he too was unable to hold\\ntogether a working coalition of parties to oppose the Nazis, who refused to\\nparticipate in any government that was not led by a Nazi Chancellor. Some of\\nthe Nazi leadership, particularly Gregor Strasser who was the #2 man in the\\nparty at the time, wanted to participate in a coalition government. But others,\\nknowing the party's support was waning, figured that their best hope to gain\\npower lay in undermining the democratic process. Nevertheless, the country\\nwas governed for seven months by Chancellors who were not Nazis, even though\\nthe Nazis were the largest Reichstag party. The failure of these men to\\nachieve a working coalition was due to the inability of their coalition\\nparties to work together.\\n\\nHere's how William Shirer puts it in _The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich_:\\n\\n   The cardinal error of the Germans who opposed Nazism was their\\n   failure to unite against it. At the crest of their popular strength,\\n   in July 1932, the National Socialists had attained but 37 percent of\\n   the vote. But the 63 percent of the German people who expressed their\\n   opposition to Hitler were much too divided and shortsighted to combine\\n   against a common danger which they must have known would overwhelm\\n   them unless they united, however temporarily, to stamp it out.\\n\\nTrue, the German people supported Hitler after he became Chancellor. But\\nthat doesn't change the fact that there was not overwhelming support for him\\n*before* he was in power. The German people were not crying out for Hitler to\\ntake over, no matter how bad economic conditions were. The leftist parties\\n(Socialists/Communists) probably had more support in total than the Nazis.\\nHitler used the fact that others were passively or actively willing to see\\nthe government paralyzed as a means to taking it over.\\n\\n-----\\nEric Smith\\nerics@netcom.com\\nerics@infoserv.com\\nCI$: 70262,3610\\n\\n\",\n",

They show an application for a ultra-long time\\ndelay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this\\napplication, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger\\npins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is\\ndisabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.\\nWhen triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x\\nthe timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can\\nbe programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting\\nany combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it\\nis, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K\\nresistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of\\n2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)\\nOf course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for\\n256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.\\nAfter the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14\\nday timing cycle and so forth.\\n\\nPower is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the\\nelectronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet\\npuker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to\\nkeep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to\\nwork for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts\\nto spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see\\nwhat I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that\\nhas to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns\\noff ;-)\\n\\nThanks again everyone...\\n\\n-=-= Wes =-=-\\n\",\n",

Jesus is not soloing you out.\\nJesus is making a general statement about out the sad state of man.\\nChristians are not immuned from doing evil things.  A Christian \\nis just a person in whom the Holy Spirit indwells.  A Christian \\ncan see the evil he is doing--because his evil has been brought\\nout into the light.  Jesus is not saying that just because evil has been\\nexposed, that the Christian will stop doing evil.  If you haven\\'t\\nseen Jesus\\'s light, your evil deeds simply haven\\'t been\\nexposed to the His light.  You may shed some light on your\\nown.  Your human spirit shines at perhaps 1 candela.  But the\\nHoly Spirit shines at a Megacandela.  The Holy Spirit can\\nshine light into places inside us where we didn\\'t even know\\nexisted. \\n\\nSo do you see Jesus\\'s point?  Christians are not perfect.  Nonchristians\\nare not perfect.  Nonchristians do not want to come into the\\nLight of Jesus because they will see all the problems in their lives,\\nand they will not like the sight.  It is an ugly thing to see how far\\nwe have fallen from Jesus\\'s perspective.  Do you think you want to\\nknow how really ignorant you are?  Do you think Brian Kendig wants\\nto know?

It is even sadder that the people who\\ndied with him chose to die with them, and that ignorance was\\ntheir downfall to death. \\n\\nAnd Kent, don\\'t you bury yourself underneath a rock with an\\nexcuse like bringing up Koresh--as if Koresh actually had truth in him.\\nDavid Koresh was no light and no excuse for\\nyou to stay away from the real Jesus Christ.  David Koresh, who\\nclaimed to be Jesus, was a fraud.  It was obvious.  David Koresh\\nwas born in America. Jesus was born in Bethlehem.  Koresh wasn\\'t\\neven a good imposter having missed an obvious point as that.\\n\\nJesus warned of such imposters in the end-times.  David\\nKoresh wasn\\'t anything new to Jesus.  Jesus told us to be\\naware of imposters 2000 years ago.  \\n\\nSo the next time an imposter makes a scene and claims to\\nbe Jesus.  Ask the obvious.  Where were you born?  Was your\\nmother\\'s name Mary?  If the Branch Davidians asked that\\nsimple question, they would have labeled Koresh a liar\\nright from the start.  The wouldn\\'t have followed Koresh.\\nThey wouldn\\'t have died.  But look what happened.  Their\\nignorance cost them their lives.  Their choice to be ignorant\\ncost them a lot.\\n\\nKent, since you studied the Bible under Lutheranism, do you\\nnot remember what tactic Satan used to try to tempt Jesus?  \\nDid not Satan quote the Bible out of context?  Do you\\nremember what tactic the serpent of Genesis used to tempt\\nEve?  Did he not misquote God?  What Satan used on Eve and succeeded, \\nwas the same ploy he tried on Jesus.  But in Jesus\\'s case,\\nJesus rebuked Satan back with the Bible _in_ context.  It\\ndidn\\'t work with Jesus.  \\n\\nDoes what Satan did to Eve in the Garden and what Satan\\ntried to do with Jesus in the desert remind you of what\\nKoresh did to his followers?

Did not\\nthe cult followers believe Koresh even though they knew\\nthe real Christ was born in Bethlehem?   Did not Eve\\nchoose to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and\\nevil despite knowing that it would cause her death?  God\\nheld them all responsible--deceiver and the rebeller.

In\\n    general, however, systems connected to \\'the net\\' fall in one of three\\n    categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent\\n    between these networks, and other resources available on one of these\\n    networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to\\n    special \\'servers\\'.\\n\\n    The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of\\n    several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.\\n\\n    One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central\\n    distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In\\n    addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for\\n    Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more\\n    specialized mailing lists described below.\\n\\n    A second mechanism is Usenet \\'netnews\\'. This is somewhat like a bulletin\\n    board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews\\n    separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a\\n    \\'group name\\'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are\\n    called \\'sci.space.news\\', \\'sci.space\\', \\'sci.space.shuttle\\', \\'sci.astro\\',\\n    and \\'talk.politics.space\\'. Contributors \\'post\\' submissions (called\\n    \\'articles\\' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends\\n    it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby\\n    machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so\\n    that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet\\n    sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was\\n    posted.\\n\\n    Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and\\n    BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not\\n    accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more\\n    flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make\\n    it the preferred option.\\n\\nMAILING LISTS\\n\\n    SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the\\n    International Space University (in only its second change of management\\n    in over a decade).

Retrieve\\n\\tjulius.cs.qub.ac.uk:pub/SpaceDigestArchive/README\\n    for further details.\\n\\n    Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle\\n    Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights. NASA two line\\n    elements are sent out on the list from Dr. Kelso, JSC, and other sources\\n    as they are released.

Ipser, Jr., 1993\\n>\\n\\nHere\\'s my own top ten response to Mr. Ipser\\'s list\\n\\n\\n10.  It\\'s about time we have a President that might actually stand up to the\\n     military.  Our men and women in uniform must learn that the world does not\\n     revolve around them, and that one of the things they\\'re out there defending\\n     is our right to be critical of them, even denounce them.\\n\\n9.   Let me explain something to you.  Environmental policy and industrial\\n     policy MUST go hand in hand.  Our nation, and indeed, our planet cannot\\n     afford to continue ignoring this as was done over the last twelve years.\\n     Our industrial/environmental position has been downright SHAMEFUL! We\\n     must have active government support of the key industries such as,\\n     telecommunications, microelectronics, medical, biotech, and environmental\\n     tech.  Meanwhile weed out old, inneficient, high-polution, industries\\n     that are better left to other nations.  This will make us richer, help\\n     produce new jobs, and help the environment.  To give credit where credit\\n     is due, I heard a lot of this in a speech by Senator John Kerry (D-MA)\\n     tonite.  In addition, it\\'s time we get really, really serious about \\n     issues like overpopulation, globabl warming, and ozone depletion.  The\\n     planet on which we live should be our utmost priority!\\n\\n8.   It just so happens that that it takes money to make this country work,\\n     to provide the services that people need, and to help solve the problems\\n     that need to be solved.  Granted, some things can probably be done more\\n     efficiently for less money, and should be.  But some things are going to\\n     cost more money and I\\'m sick and tired of hearing everyone whining about\\n     taxes all the time.  You want to live in my country, you pay your fair\\n     share!\\n\\n7.   I can\\'t believe what hypocrites people are when they ask people to give\\n     up their lives for their country and then complain about taxes.  If you\\'re\\n     willing to send me off to die for some stupid obsession with fighting an\\n     enemy which at best doesn\\'t affect us and at worst really should be our\\n     friend, then you have no right to tell me you shouldn\\'t pay taxes!\\n\\n6.   Hey, I think the beaded curtains add a lovely 60\\'s-esque touch!\\n\\n5.   Look, Canada, Europe, and Japan manage to provide health care for their\\n     citizens (and, yes, basic health IS a human right which people are\\n     entitled to).  If these nations aren\\'t capitalist enough for you, then\\n     I guess we\\'ve found something better than capitalism!  There is nothing\\n     sacred about the capitalist system, and if something, be it socialism\\n     or anything else, works better, then I say let capitalism die.\\n\\n4.   Make love, not War!\\n\\n3.   Contrary to popular belief, it is possible to be a male and a feminist\\n     at the same time.  To discriminate against or to deny equal opportunity\\n     to a MAJORITY of the population is just plain wrong, and trying to force\\n     them into some sort of tradition role is even worse.  Women certainly \\n     have as much to offer this world as men, and the day that gender\\n     discrimination is finally broken it going to make all the revolutions of\\n     the past few centuries seem like reform bills.  I look forward to it.\\n\\n2.   See number 10.\\n\\n1.

I will begin Greek studies on\\nthese passages in more depth than I thought necessary, as well.\\n \\nDB...\\n\"It would be appropriate to look at what Mr DeCenso has actually USED as\\nevidence.  Now we know what he claims for a standard, as he has stated it\\noften enough:\\n \\n> (a) the text itself\\n> (b) parallel passages\\n> (c) other pertinent Scriptures\\n> (d) historical context\\n> (e) historical content\\n> (f) other pertinent historical info\\n> (g) cultural context\\n> (h) cultural content\\n> (i) other pertinent cultural info\\n> (j) grammatical construction\\n> (k) Hebrew and Greek word studies\\n> (l) etc.\\n \\nBut are these actual standards he has used, or simply empty hyperbole.  Let\\'s\\nsee, he has used (a), and since he is trying to reconcile it to other\\npassages, we see that he has also used (b).  On the other hand he has\\npresented no use of:\\n \\n(d) historical context                or\\n(e) historical content                or\\n(f) other pertinent historical info   or\\n(g) cultural context                  or\\n(h) cultural content                  or\\n(i) other pertinent cultural info     or\\n(j) grammatical construction          or even\\n(k) Hebrew and Greek word studies [remember, Archer and Bullinger don\\'t count]\\n \\nThus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings.\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nQuestion:  Do you find such criteria important?  If so, do you plan on starting\\nto use them to the best of your ability, or will you continue to present\\nshallow observations (I don\\'t mean this in a bad way).\\nAt this point in our _debates_, I have not found it necessary to present a\\ntotal exegetical analysis of these passages, since we seem to keep beating\\naround the bush and not getting into the core of the verses.  I do not believe\\nit necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re:\\nJudas in Acts and Matthew, but I will do my best from this point on to use\\nseveral of the above criteria, since you desire me to.  I hope you will also.\\nIt will greatly enhance our study of these passages.\\n \\nDB...\\n\"The only thing he has actually used, beyond the passage itself, is any other\\npassage.  Thus Mr DeCenso should be honest and note that most of his list is\\nred herring and his only real criteria seems to be:\\n \\n> (a) the text itself\\n> (b) parallel passages\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nThe reason is simple...you are mistating the passages.  You claim that the\\nPASSAGES contradict one another; I do not see the PASSAGES contradicting one\\nanother.\\n(1) They may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention;\\n(2) Matthew may not be presenting Judas\\' death, as you claim.  But we\\'ll look\\nat your defense of this later.\\n \\nAlso, the \"reward of iniquity\" in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the 30 pieces of\\nsilver in Matthew\\'s PASSAGES.  (Although you have a valiant attempt later at\\nstating why you believe it is).\\n \\nAt this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some Scriptural\\ngroundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis.\\n \\nDB...\\n\"Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage\\nas he has done with Judas\\' death, is to make it agree with another passage so\\nthat both could be considered correct.\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nOne of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is\\nthat you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these\\npassages are complimentary.  However, I see no problem in Tony Rose\\'s\\nexplanation of Judas\\' death...\\n \\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n \\nHOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING\\nHIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND \"FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN\"\\n=============================================================\\n \\nThis question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are\\nconstantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent\\ndiscrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error.\\nSome have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is\\ndestroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at\\nall.\\nMatthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and\\nwas crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do\\nthey necessarily contradict each other?\\nMatthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that\\nJudas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling\\nsomething black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be\\ntrue and supplementary.\\nA possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the\\nedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there\\nfor some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas\\nfell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.\\nThe fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this\\nexplanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the\\nvalley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see\\nrocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.\\nThere are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\\nTherefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on\\nthis way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are\\nnot told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced\\nwas the decomposition of his body before his fall.\\nLouis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself.\\nThis individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a\\npistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at\\nthe same time.\\nOn the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting\\nhimself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping\\nform the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the\\ncase of Matthew\\'s and Peter\\'s accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a\\nsituation of different perspectives of the same event.\\n \\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n \\nYour only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit\\ninerrancy.  You haven\\'t related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely.\\nHere\\'s what you said in an earlier post...\\n \\n_____________________________________________________________________\\nDB [quoting Tony Rose]...\\n> There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\\n> Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks\\n> on this way down, tearing his body open.

But you seem to\\nfind Tony Rose\\'s eisegesis satisfactory, while clearly rejecting David\\nJoslin\\'s.\"\\n \\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n \\nHere, you discredit Tony\\'s explanation based on what you deem too \"heavy\" for\\nthe passages.  But you haven\\'t addressed why you feel that way.  You can say\\nit\\'s a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn\\'t tell me it\\ndidn\\'t happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility.\\n \\nQuestions:  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying?  Or are they both lying?  Or\\nare either or both of them misinformed?  Why do you think there is such an\\nalleged contradiction?  I do not think you have ever told us what you believe\\nin this respect.\\n \\nDB...\\n\"At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me:\\n \\n> (1) You claim Acts and Matthew contradict one another in representing Judas\\'\\n>     death.  I ask you again to provide evidence that Matthew stated Judas\\n>     died in the hanging.\\n> (2) You claim that the 30 pieces of silver in Matthew that Judas threw down\\n>     in the temple and the chief priests used, is the \"reward of iniquity\"\\n>     in Acts that pictures Judas in some way purchasing a field with;\\n>     therefore there is a contradiction.  Prove that the 30 pieces of silver\\n>     and the \"reward of iniquity\" are one and the same.\\n \\nActually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer\\nit because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point out\\nthat hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is a\\nbit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy\\nmovies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nI work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got a\\ncall re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother\\nis on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child\\'s psych ward at a\\nlocal hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful.\\n \\nTo assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is\\n\"begging the question\", if I may quote you.\\n \\n[Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The Christian\\nResearch Institute\\'s show, one of the scholars on there used several of these\\nterms that you use.  I am not all that familiar with them.  The man on the BAM\\nshow teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.  It was interesting]\\n \\nDB...\\n\"This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other\\nqualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself.\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nQualifiers are important at times, as we\\'ll see in an OT passage I\\'ll mention\\nbelow.\\nDoes hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we\\nhave re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it\\'s\\nsynonymous means it has the same meaning as.  A boy (age 14) hung himself.  But\\nhe lived.  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can\\ndiscover.\\n \\nDB...\\n\"Now I am not alone in this thought; in fact, since Mr DeCenso so respects\\nChristian scholarly (including Greek scholars) opinion, I did some research.\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nThank you, Dave.\\n \\nDB...\\n\"Interestingly, not one of the Christian references I read, interpreted the\\nhanging as being anything but a fatal suicide.              ^^^^^^^^^^^\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\n[^^^ above, mine]\\nSo it\\'s OK to use Christian sources to back your points?  What about Tony\\'s\\nposition.  Do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility?\\n \\nAlso, is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong, or lying, or\\ndeceived in other parts of their books?  If so, should we do, as we have done\\nwith Archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including\\ntheir \"interpretation\" of the hanging of Judas?  I am sure _you_ would find\\nsome errors and maybe even some deception in those sources.\\n \\nYou also noted they \"interpreted\" the hanging as meaning he died.  Although\\nthat is very possibly true, do you find that in the text itself?

Sept.,\\nAPAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, \"and died\".  Here we have no doubt of the\\nresult.\\nIn Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.\\n \\nAlso, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simply\\nmeans \"hang oneself\".\\n \\nDB...\\n\"But Mr DeCenso, you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable\\n                                                                     ^^^^^^^^^\\nChristian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful.\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\n[^^^above, mine]\\n\"Reputable\"?

But the chief priests took the silver pieces and\\nsaid, \"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the\\nprice of blood.\" And they consulted together and bought with them the potter\\'s\\nfield, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of\\nBlood to this day.\\n \\nFirst of all, notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result of\\nhanging. All it says is that he \"went and hanged himself.\" Luke however, in\\nActs, tells us that \"and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all\\nhis entrails gushed out.\" This is a pretty clear indication (along with the\\nother details given in Acts - Peter\\'s speech, the need to pick a new apostle,\\netc.) that at least after Judas\\' fall, he was dead.

Now I would point out\\nthat when the Bible describes an act of \"iniquity,\" and then immediately\\ndiscusses \"*the* reward of iniquity,\" it would be rather inane to suggest that\\nit was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nDave, we are getting somewhere, aren\\'t we!\\n \\nACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples\\n(altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said,\\nACT 1:16 \"Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy\\nSpirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide\\nto those who arrested Jesus;\\nACT 1:17 \"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\"\\nACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and\\nfalling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.\\nACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field\\nis called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.)\\nACT 1:20 \"For it is written in the book of Psalms: \\'Let his dwelling place be\\ndesolate, And let no one live in it\\'; and, \\'Let another take his office.\\'\\n \\nNotice that in verse 16, the word \"iniquity\" is not used.  Rather, it states\\nthat Judas \"became a guide to those who arrested Jesus\".\\nBut the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \"for he was numbered with us and\\nobtained a part in this ministry.\"  What part did Judas play in their ministry?\\n         ^^^^^^\\nJOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a\\nthief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it.\\nJOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had\\nsaid to him, \"Buy those things we need for the feast,\" or that he should give\\nsomething to the poor.\\n \\nSo, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se.\\nRight after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer,\\naccording to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of \"wages of\\niniquity\" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen\\nby Judas to purchase a field.

The magnitude of such accelerations he\\nestimated to be on the order of 700g. He also says that this is may not\\nbe a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was published\\nin 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g. All this is very\\nlong-winded but here\\'s my question finally - Are 45g accelerations in\\nfact humanly tolerable? - with the aid of any mechanical devices of\\ncourse. If these are possible, what is used to absorb the acceleration?\\nCan this be extended to larger accelerations?\\n\\nThanks is advance...\\n-Amruth Laxman\\n\\n',\n",

Thus\\n>> it would seem to be a very good thing you dumped Archer as a reference).\\n> \\n> I was wrong. I admit that I do not have a handle on Greek grammar, and thus\\n> confused \"kleros\", the second to last word in Acts 1:17 as being the plot of\\n> land discussed.  In actuality it is \"chorion\", which is the last word Acts\\n> 1:18.  Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss \"chorion\" so I\\n> cannot report as to the nuances of the word.\\n\\nI abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from\\nothers, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I do\\nnot feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in\\nthis example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research\\nspecifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not\\nas tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am\\nnot competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns\\nout that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \"Greek Lexicon\" renders\\neach verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical\\norder.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is\\nfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes\\nthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is\\nindeed \"chorion.\" \\n\\nNow I\\'ve checked several Greek-English lexicons:\\n\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\\n\\t\"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\\n\\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\\n\\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \\n\\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\\n\\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\\n\\nIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:\\n\\n\\tA space, place, region, district, field, area, \"country place,\" \\n\\tland, farm, estate, \"a bit of tillage\", and similar meanings.\\n\\nNowhere do any of these books mention anything about \"grave.\" As some of these \\nbooks go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books \\nare all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I \\nthink it more likely that Mr Archer\\'s investigations into \"contradictions\" to \\nbe once again, as your friend said it, \"lacking in substance,\" and thus Archer \\nis again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would \\nhave honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them\\nto support Mr Archer\\'s contentions). \\n\\nBy the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson\\'s) is the definition of\\n\"agros,\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word\\n\"agros\" is defined as \"a field in the country.\" Chorion is specifically noted\\nas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly\\nBullinger\\'s exegisis was, which stated that the word for \"field\" in Matthew\\n(ie: agros) is different from the word for \"field\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and\\nthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already\\nadmit how stupid Bullinger\\'s exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity\\nwhich drives the point home). \\n\\nSo as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise\\n(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this \\nparticular issue closed.

(Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed)\\n(also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was\\nprobably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...)\\n\\tAs the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo\\npopulation should show anisotropy (a local disk population is\\nruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you\\nhave to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism\\nof getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should start\\nto see for example the Andromeda\\'s bursters.\\n\\tThe data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution\\n(but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with\\nthe right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence\\nisotropy) and the edge is \"the edge of the Universe\" ;-)\\nIf at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect)\\nand a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star\\ncolliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then getting\\nthe spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.\\n\\n\\tIf we know anything about physics at that level,\\nthe bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic\\nstrings, wrong spectrum for one thing.\\n\\nThe situation is further complicated by recent claims that\\nthere are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NS\\nthey\\'d actually probably fit relatively easily into the\\nNS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]\\n\\n   my own pet theory is that it\\'s  Flying saucers  entering\\n   hyperspace :-)\\n\\n   but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they\\n   are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered\\n   if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.\\n\\nIf you can think of one, remember to invite me to Stockholm...\\n\\n*  Steinn Sigurdsson   \\t\\t\\tLick Observatory      \\t*\\n*  steinly@lick.ucsc.edu\\t\\t\"standard disclaimer\"  \\t*\\n*  The laws of gravity are very,very strict\\t\\t\\t*\\n*  And you\\'re just bending them for your own benefit - B.B. 1988*\\n',\n",

EDT\n\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that \nOctavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today \nabout why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to \nget a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature \nof learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of \npeople like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of \nthose who are here.  \n\t     \n\t     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education \nand all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my \ngood friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and \nall of the business and local community leaders from the city and \ncounty and state level from around America who are here. \n\t     \n\t     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved \nhearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is \ntheir future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A \nyear and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because \nI was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our \ncountry, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had \ntoo little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines \nof income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to \ntake us into the future.  \n\t     \n\t     I entered with the hope that together we could create \nmore opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of \nour people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of \nAmerica's community, knowing that together we could always to more \nthan we could individually and that we might secure our future.\n\t     \n\t     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 \njobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the \ncommitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, \nand those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs \ndoes, and the successes of all the young people like those on this \nstage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all \nthose things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're \non the right track.\n\t     \n\t     Last July when I was traveling across America's \nheartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in \nLouisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business \npeople who were participating in the Louisville Education and \nEmployment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  \nI saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed \nboth in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my \nown state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about \n-- that for millions of American young people it is really an \nimpediment to both their learning and their ability to be good \nworkers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what \nis learning.\n\t     \n\t     In the world in which we are living, the average young \nperson will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a \nlifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning \nworld much better.  And we must determine that all of our young \npeople see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased \nhere today.  \n\t     \n\t     Whether you're in business or in government or in \neducation, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to \nbuilding a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all \nof our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things \nare pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best \nthing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have \njobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  \n\t     \n\t     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty \ngood education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that \nthey'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either \npolitical or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great \nchallenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to \nfully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work \nfor them to do.\n\t     \n\t     All the European countries have higher unemployment \nrates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the \nunemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  \nThey're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its \nmost rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that \nI have proposed to create jobs. \n\t     \n\t     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now \nabout as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  \nIt costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of \npressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing \ntheir own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their \npeople.  \n\t     \n\t     But it is especially important for America for two \nreasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move \naggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be \ncompetitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, \neven if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed \nof the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to \nwork in this country.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some \nof it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and \nmoving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We \nhave now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big \norganizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they \nare organized and who ask whether there are too many people working \nat some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to \ncreate jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the \nchance to work.  \n\t     \n\t     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare \nreform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of \nmonths -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the \nend of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of \nthe American people to perform without regard to race or income or \nthe circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that \nthere are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their \ntalent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  \nI do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if \nyou want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more \nresponsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this \ncountry that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you \nhave got to have opportunity in that mix. \n\t     \n\t     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for \nevery young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules \nand work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be \nsomething at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are \nbasically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, \nrecognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of \nour people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their \nbackground.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's \nsomething there for them to do?\n\n\t     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an \nintegral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of \nwork and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people \nfirst, and it does have a partnership between the public and private \nsector.\n\t     \n\t     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in \nFebruary on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 \nextra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the \nAmerican business community to meet that target so that we can create  \nmore than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been \ncreated before.\n\t     \n\t     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And \nJerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in \nthis room and around the country -- people who are going to do more \nthan they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people \na work experience.  And it is terribly important.\n\t     \n\t     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is \npart of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the \nAmerican people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their \njobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving \nthe transition from school to work for young people who don't go to \ncollege but do need at least two years of post-high school training \neither on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, \nso that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more \npeople to go on to college who do want to go.\n\t     \n\t     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive \nplan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The \nemergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would \ncreate a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and \nthat would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It \nwould also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work \nforce in jobs that otherwise will not be created.\n\t     \n\t      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to \ninvest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --\nprojects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, \nnew industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities \n-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve \nthe environment.  \n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs program is an important part of that \nbecause we have tried for the first time, through the work of the \nLabor Department and the Education Department and through reaching \nout to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer \njobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to \nhopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young \npeople into further educational opportunities and to further job \nopportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component \nto these summer jobs -- something that the United States government \nhas never fully emphasized before.  \n\t     \n\t     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because \nthey come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in \ndifficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building \ntheir basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other \nareas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who \nhave difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what \nthey learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next \nyear.  \n\t     \n\t     What we are trying to do here is to give people the \nopportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning \nskills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next \ncouple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school \nin this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning \nenvironment.  \n\t     \n\t     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities \nfor people to learn and work during the school year, so that this \nwill not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will \nbe a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new \nwork experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.\n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-\nwork jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding \nthe job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help \nto build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve \nlocal problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public \nbuildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in \nhospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, \nand learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while \nthey earn, but letting them earn.\n\t     \n\t     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people \nwho have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should \ndo this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the \nopportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing \nin going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't \nexactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare \nsystem; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people \nto work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the \nuse of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if \nyou're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to \nreward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     The young people we propose to put to work under our \nprogram will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, \nreading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will \nstretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a \nsense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, \nbut a challenge that will take them into a different life.\n\t     \n\t     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even \nas I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the \nsummer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll \nsee whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer \nacademically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved \nahead.  I suspect that they will.  \n\t     \n\t     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I \nwill be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn \nfrom you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next \nsummer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school \nyear, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that \nwe do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so \nthat we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private \ninvestments as well. \n\t     \n\t     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the \nbusiness leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this \nsummer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business \nwho have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who \nhaven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about \nthis event today, I want to implore other private employers to \nstretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this \nsummer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when \nwe don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort \nthem to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up \nhere on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking \nabout work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've \ndone to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very \nfoolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand \nand sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had \never had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be \nworth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     That does not mean young people should not be \nentrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation \nahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and \nworked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  \nAnd I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some \npeople say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  \n\t     \n\t     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I \ngrew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul \nwithout regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a \njob.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to \npeople is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a \njob and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now \nI live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any \nmore money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're \nworking longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  \nAnd we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these \nyoung people want.\n\t     \n\t     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  \nIt doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration \npursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private \nsector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn \nhow to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created \nin this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done \noff-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a \nthird or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do \neconomically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of \nAmerica's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just \nkidding.  \n\t     \n\t     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy \ncountry in the world, including the United States, is having \ndifficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done \nI'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole \ndeliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the \nanswers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     And so the jobs program that I have presented to \nCongress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the \ncounties, through the Community Development Program, with the \ninfrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an \nattempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the \neconomy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little \nboost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a \nmillion jobs and maybe get the engine going again.\n\t     \n\t     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in \nthe private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government \nmoney.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American \neconomy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind \nof system we have and it works pretty well.  \n\t     \n\t     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you \nhere today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends \nand neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers \nto make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the \nfunds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government \nshould create this summer, so that together we can have this \npartnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a \nfuture -- a future that our young people can believe in.  \n\t     \n\t     We need to send them a message that here in America if \nyou study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute \nsomething to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  \nYou can build a future from you own dreams. \n\t     \n\t     That has always been the promise of America.  Together \nthat's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of \nthe promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise \nhas been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.\n\t     \n\t     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\n\n                                 END11:45 A.M. EDT\n\n\n\n",

I don't\n>have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:\n>\n>[...]  Any stories on how you all learned?\n\nI'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.\n\nEarly in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on\nhis old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I\nactually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.\n\nI proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and\nrode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to\ninvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then\nI also passed my road test.\n\nOn May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a\n4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),\nI had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,\nskidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the\noncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was\nalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under\na car and been killed.\n\nNow this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the\nExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training\ncould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater\nsince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff\nas I did.\n\nSo my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I\nwouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you\nhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until\nyou're ready to use it.\n\n>1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have \n>to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too \n>ignorant to know I need to buy)\n\nWhile you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in\nDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you\nsave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,\nplus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure\nthe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up\nmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration\nand licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not\nincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.\n\n>2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in \n>about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up\n>till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a \n>motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes\n>a difference)\n\nI pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200\nin Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial\ncoverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be\npoor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo\nmore expensive.\n\n>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?\n\nThere used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle\nmagazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or\nrecent models might be available.  You could probably look through\npast issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first\nbike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice\ninstead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that\nare parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by\nnoticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around\nand they were generally set up the way I wanted.\n\nNothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting\nshowrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,\nwere very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and\nquoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence\ncheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.\n\n-- David Karr (karr@cs.cornell.edu)\n-- '80 BMW R65   DoD #0969   also BMWMOA, NRA, ACLU, et al.\n\n\n",

No cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look \nvery clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. All \nstill within factory specs. The only thing I could find, however, was a \nslightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder (the one with the problem), \nbut it is still way below the wear-limit given in the Clymer-manual for \nthis bike. \nAny syggestions??? What else could cause my problem??? Do I have to hone \nthe cylinder walls (make them a little rougher in a criss-cross-pattern) in \norder to get better breaking in of my new rings??? Won't that increase the \nwear of my pistons??\nPlease send comments to \n\tsruhl@mechanical.watstar.uwaterloo.ca\nThanks in advance.

Do the gases really \n>compress that much?\n\n    For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses\nin the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.\n\n1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force\nair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake\nvalve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only\nthe difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after\nthe exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the\nintake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing\natmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time\ndoes the pressure ever become \"negative\", or even approach a good\nvacuum.\n\n2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the\ncombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up\nto the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume\nof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume\nthat must flow through the intake, because of the temperature\ndifference and the products of combustion.\n\n3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started\npaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty\nhorsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,\nsubstitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost\nzero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very\nwell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make\nvery little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is\n_much_ louder than the stocker.\n\n4.

EDT\n             \n             \n             THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  My voice is coming to\nyou this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio\nstation in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to\nmeet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,\nhealth care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly\nbroadcast with the American people. \n             \n             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when\nit reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past\nseven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with\nthe people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus\ntour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last\nyear's campaign.\n             \n             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with\nyou, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and\nwhat I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting\nto you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.\n             \n             You sent me to Washington to get our government and\neconomy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad\nexperiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important\nit is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do\nbusiness.  \n             \n             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations\nrise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness\nof their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the\ncooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,\nlabor and government.  Although many of the economies of the\nindustrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've\nmade many of the smart investments and the tough choices which\nour government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them\nhave been moving ahead and too many of our people have been\nfalling behind.\n             \n             We have an economy today that even when it grows is\nnot producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation\nby four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to\nshow for it.  We know that wages of most working people have\nstopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks\nand that too many families can no longer afford the escalating\ncost of health care.\n             \n             But we also know that, given the right tools, the\nright incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and\nbusinesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy\nneeds to expand opportunity and to make our communities better\nplaces to live.\n             \n             In many critical products today Americans are the\nlow cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that\nwe create more of those kinds of jobs.\n             \n             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for\nlong-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old\npriorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to\nbe -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs\nand education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the\nwaste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious\nresources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the\ngroundwork for robust economic growth in the future.\n             \n             These new directions passed the Congress in record\ntime and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our\ncountry.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would\ncreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private\nsector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It\nnow has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. \nBut it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the\nSenate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know\nwould result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.\n             \n             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. \nMillions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and\ncounting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill\nhas been grounded by gridlock.  \n             \n             I know the American people are tired of business as\nusual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin\nor wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have\ntaken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra\nmile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25\npercent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  \n             \n             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million\nAmericans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill\nlanguish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean\nhundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to\nact to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking\nthis initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I\nthink we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant\nportion of our original goals.\n             \n             First, we want to keep the programs as much as\npossible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,\nincluding highway and road construction, summer jobs for young\npeople, immunization for children, construction of waste water\nsites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding\nfor extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who\nhave been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't\ncreating jobs.\n             \n             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs\nin the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40\npercent.\n             \n             And third, I've recommended a new element in this\nprogram to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against\ncrime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire\npolice officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put\nthem back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight\nfor a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it\nand deserve it.\n             \n             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --\nthe Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it\nincreases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this\nyear that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,\ndoesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more\nthan paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this\nbudget is well within the spending limits already approved by the\nCongress this year.\n             \n             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators\nwho are filibustering the bill voted during the previous\nadministration for billions of dollars of the same kind of\nemergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the\nAmerican people to work.  \n             \n             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered\na plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities\nare -- on people or on politics.  \n             \n             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar\nfor dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the\nsoundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our\nchildren.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs\nand investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of\nus when we've helped make more American partners working to\nensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.\n             \n             You know, if every American who wanted a job had\none, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this\ncountry today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first\nstep to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country\nagain.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid\nfor over the life of our budget.\n             \n             Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how\nimportant the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.\n             \n             Good morning, and thank you for listening.\n\n                               END                 10:11 A.M. EDT\n\n\n\n",

                  "\nYou can get a *little* UV by putting a heavy UV filter (deep purple) in\nfront of an ordinary flashlight bulb (the brightest you can get).\nMy father used a setup like this in law enforcement work circa 1964.\n\nGood UV (\"blacklight\") bulbs work like fluorescent bulbs.

EDT\n\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that \nOctavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today \nabout why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to \nget a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature \nof learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of \npeople like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of \nthose who are here.  \n\t     \n\t     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education \nand all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my \ngood friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and \nall of the business and local community leaders from the city and \ncounty and state level from around America who are here. \n\t     \n\t     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved \nhearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is \ntheir future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A \nyear and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because \nI was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our \ncountry, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had \ntoo little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines \nof income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to \ntake us into the future.  \n\t     \n\t     I entered with the hope that together we could create \nmore opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of \nour people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of \nAmerica's community, knowing that together we could always to more \nthan we could individually and that we might secure our future.\n\t     \n\t     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 \njobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the \ncommitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, \nand those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs \ndoes, and the successes of all the young people like those on this \nstage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all \nthose things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're \non the right track.\n\t     \n\t     Last July when I was traveling across America's \nheartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in \nLouisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business \npeople who were participating in the Louisville Education and \nEmployment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  \nI saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed \nboth in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my \nown state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about \n-- that for millions of American young people it is really an \nimpediment to both their learning and their ability to be good \nworkers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what \nis learning.\n\t     \n\t     In the world in which we are living, the average young \nperson will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a \nlifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning \nworld much better.  And we must determine that all of our young \npeople see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased \nhere today.  \n\t     \n\t     Whether you're in business or in government or in \neducation, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to \nbuilding a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all \nof our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things \nare pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best \nthing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have \njobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  \n\t     \n\t     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty \ngood education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that \nthey'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either \npolitical or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great \nchallenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to \nfully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work \nfor them to do.\n\t     \n\t     All the European countries have higher unemployment \nrates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the \nunemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  \nThey're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its \nmost rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that \nI have proposed to create jobs. \n\t     \n\t     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now \nabout as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  \nIt costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of \npressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing \ntheir own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their \npeople.  \n\t     \n\t     But it is especially important for America for two \nreasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move \naggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be \ncompetitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, \neven if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed \nof the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to \nwork in this country.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some \nof it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and \nmoving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We \nhave now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big \norganizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they \nare organized and who ask whether there are too many people working \nat some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to \ncreate jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the \nchance to work.  \n\t     \n\t     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare \nreform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of \nmonths -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the \nend of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of \nthe American people to perform without regard to race or income or \nthe circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that \nthere are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their \ntalent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  \nI do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if \nyou want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more \nresponsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this \ncountry that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you \nhave got to have opportunity in that mix. \n\t     \n\t     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for \nevery young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules \nand work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be \nsomething at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are \nbasically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, \nrecognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of \nour people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their \nbackground.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's \nsomething there for them to do?\n\n\t     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an \nintegral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of \nwork and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people \nfirst, and it does have a partnership between the public and private \nsector.\n\t     \n\t     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in \nFebruary on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 \nextra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the \nAmerican business community to meet that target so that we can create  \nmore than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been \ncreated before.\n\t     \n\t     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And \nJerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in \nthis room and around the country -- people who are going to do more \nthan they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people \na work experience.  And it is terribly important.\n\t     \n\t     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is \npart of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the \nAmerican people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their \njobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving \nthe transition from school to work for young people who don't go to \ncollege but do need at least two years of post-high school training \neither on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, \nso that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more \npeople to go on to college who do want to go.\n\t     \n\t     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive \nplan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The \nemergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would \ncreate a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and \nthat would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It \nwould also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work \nforce in jobs that otherwise will not be created.\n\t     \n\t      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to \ninvest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --\nprojects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, \nnew industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities \n-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve \nthe environment.  \n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs program is an important part of that \nbecause we have tried for the first time, through the work of the \nLabor Department and the Education Department and through reaching \nout to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer \njobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to \nhopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young \npeople into further educational opportunities and to further job \nopportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component \nto these summer jobs -- something that the United States government \nhas never fully emphasized before.  \n\t     \n\t     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because \nthey come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in \ndifficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building \ntheir basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other \nareas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who \nhave difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what \nthey learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next \nyear.  \n\t     \n\t     What we are trying to do here is to give people the \nopportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning \nskills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next \ncouple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school \nin this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning \nenvironment.  \n\t     \n\t     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities \nfor people to learn and work during the school year, so that this \nwill not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will \nbe a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new \nwork experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.\n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-\nwork jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding \nthe job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help \nto build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve \nlocal problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public \nbuildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in \nhospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, \nand learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while \nthey earn, but letting them earn.\n\t     \n\t     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people \nwho have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should \ndo this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the \nopportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing \nin going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't \nexactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare \nsystem; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people \nto work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the \nuse of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if \nyou're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to \nreward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     The young people we propose to put to work under our \nprogram will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, \nreading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will \nstretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a \nsense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, \nbut a challenge that will take them into a different life.\n\t     \n\t     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even \nas I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the \nsummer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll \nsee whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer \nacademically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved \nahead.  I suspect that they will.  \n\t     \n\t     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I \nwill be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn \nfrom you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next \nsummer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school \nyear, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that \nwe do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so \nthat we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private \ninvestments as well. \n\t     \n\t     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the \nbusiness leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this \nsummer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business \nwho have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who \nhaven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about \nthis event today, I want to implore other private employers to \nstretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this \nsummer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when \nwe don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort \nthem to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up \nhere on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking \nabout work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've \ndone to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very \nfoolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand \nand sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had \never had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be \nworth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     That does not mean young people should not be \nentrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation \nahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and \nworked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  \nAnd I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some \npeople say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  \n\t     \n\t     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I \ngrew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul \nwithout regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a \njob.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to \npeople is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a \njob and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now \nI live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any \nmore money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're \nworking longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  \nAnd we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these \nyoung people want.\n\t     \n\t     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  \nIt doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration \npursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private \nsector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn \nhow to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created \nin this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done \noff-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a \nthird or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do \neconomically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of \nAmerica's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just \nkidding.  \n\t     \n\t     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy \ncountry in the world, including the United States, is having \ndifficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done \nI'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole \ndeliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the \nanswers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     And so the jobs program that I have presented to \nCongress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the \ncounties, through the Community Development Program, with the \ninfrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an \nattempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the \neconomy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little \nboost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a \nmillion jobs and maybe get the engine going again.\n\t     \n\t     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in \nthe private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government \nmoney.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American \neconomy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind \nof system we have and it works pretty well.  \n\t     \n\t     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you \nhere today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends \nand neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers \nto make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the \nfunds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government \nshould create this summer, so that together we can have this \npartnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a \nfuture -- a future that our young people can believe in.  \n\t     \n\t     We need to send them a message that here in America if \nyou study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute \nsomething to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  \nYou can build a future from you own dreams. \n\t     \n\t     That has always been the promise of America.  Together \nthat's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of \nthe promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise \nhas been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.\n\t     \n\t     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\n\n                                 END11:45 A.M. EDT\n\n\n\n",

That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,\n   but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing\n   military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than\n   just a \"we have the money, why not?\" approach.\n\nAh, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not\nwasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) bills\nto fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be\nspent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of funding\nhigh-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various\nfields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the\ndefense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to\nfund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-European\ncooperation.\n\nNow maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of\nmoney (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as\ninvestment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at\nthe size of that multiplier :->).\n\nNick Haines nickh@cmu.edu\n",

I don't\n>have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:\n>\n>[...]  Any stories on how you all learned?\n\nI'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.\n\nEarly in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on\nhis old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I\nactually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.\n\nI proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and\nrode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to\ninvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then\nI also passed my road test.\n\nOn May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a\n4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),\nI had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,\nskidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the\noncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was\nalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under\na car and been killed.\n\nNow this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the\nExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training\ncould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater\nsince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff\nas I did.\n\nSo my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I\nwouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you\nhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until\nyou're ready to use it.\n\n>1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have \n>to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too \n>ignorant to know I need to buy)\n\nWhile you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in\nDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you\nsave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,\nplus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure\nthe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up\nmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration\nand licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not\nincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.\n\n>2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in \n>about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up\n>till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a \n>motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes\n>a difference)\n\nI pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200\nin Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial\ncoverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be\npoor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo\nmore expensive.\n\n>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?\n\nThere used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle\nmagazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or\nrecent models might be available.  You could probably look through\npast issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first\nbike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice\ninstead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that\nare parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by\nnoticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around\nand they were generally set up the way I wanted.\n\nNothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting\nshowrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,\nwere very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and\nquoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence\ncheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.\n\n-- David Karr (karr@cs.cornell.edu)\n-- '80 BMW R65   DoD #0969   also BMWMOA, NRA, ACLU, et al.\n\n\n",

Speaking from personal\nexperience, I have had judges illegally assume jurisdiction even after\nI demanded that the DA prove such jurisdiction on the record, and the\nDA stood mute.  I have also had an appellate court uphold such action\nand hide behind California Rules of Court, Rule 106 (\"The judges of\nthe appellate department shall not be required to write opinions in\nany cases decided by them, but may do so whenever they deem it\nadvisable or in the public interest.\").  That is reality, I agree.\n\n\n\n\n--\nRonald Cole                                     E-mail: zippy@ecst.csuchico.edu\nSenior Software Engineer                        Phone: +1 916 899 2100\nOPTX International                              \n            \"The Bill Of Rights -- Void Where Prohibited By Law\"\n",

                  "Organization: University of Waterloo\n\nHi, I just have a small question about my bike. \nBeing a fairly experienced BMW and MZ-Mechanic, I just don't know what to \nthink about my Honda. \nShe was using too much oil for the last 5000 km (on my trip to Daytona bike \nweek this spring), and all of a sudden, she trailed smoke like hell and \nwas running only on one cylinder. \nI towed the bike home and took it apart, but everything looks in perfect \nworking order. No cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look \nvery clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. All \nstill within factory specs. The only thing I could find, however, was a \nslightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder (the one with the problem), \nbut it is still way below the wear-limit given in the Clymer-manual for \nthis bike. \nAny syggestions??? What else could cause my problem??? Do I have to hone \nthe cylinder walls (make them a little rougher in a criss-cross-pattern) in \norder to get better breaking in of my new rings??? Won't that increase the \nwear of my pistons??\nPlease send comments to \n\tsruhl@mechanical.watstar.uwaterloo.ca\nThanks in advance.

I was doing research on subliminal suggestion for a psychology\npaper, and I read that one researcher flashed hidden messages on the\nTV screen at 1/200ths of a second.  Is that possible?  I thought the\nmaximum rate the TV was even capable of displaying images was 1/30th\nof a second.

I hear that they're called\n>'Cooling Towers' but what the heck do they cool?\n>I hope someone can help \n\n\nThe actual hourglass is hollow and is designed to generate a draft,\nexploiting the venturi effect.  Around the base of the hourglass is a\nring of water towers.  Warm river water, coming from the steam condenser\nin the plant, is sprayed over louvres.  The draft being pulled through\nthe tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection.  The\nsensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for\ndraft generation.\n\nIt should be noted that the hourglass-shaped cooling towers are used on\nboth fossile and nuclear plants.  It should also be noted that at \nlocations where water is plentiful, the cooling towers are only used part\ntime, when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit.\nIt was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish.\nFishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect.  Nontheless, stringent,\nusually state, regulations remain in some instances.  Since it typically\ntakes 60,000 hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed \nto cool a 1000 MWe plant, the cost of using the towers is not insignificant.\n-- \nJohn De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?  \nPerformance Engineering Magazine(TM) | Interested in high tech and computers? \nMarietta, Ga                         | Send ur snail-mail address to \njgd@dixie.com                        | perform@dixie.com for a free sample mag\nLee Harvey Oswald: Where are ya when we need ya?\n",

My lawyer didn't like\nthe odds since there were multiple complaints both ways and the judge had\na history of finding everyone guilty of at least something, so he convinced\nus (she came without a lawyer) to drop everything.

Do the gases really \n>compress that much?\n\n    For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses\nin the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.\n\n1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force\nair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake\nvalve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only\nthe difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after\nthe exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the\nintake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing\natmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time\ndoes the pressure ever become \"negative\", or even approach a good\nvacuum.\n\n2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the\ncombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up\nto the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume\nof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume\nthat must flow through the intake, because of the temperature\ndifference and the products of combustion.\n\n3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started\npaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty\nhorsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,\nsubstitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost\nzero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very\nwell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make\nvery little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is\n_much_ louder than the stocker.\n\n4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.\nIf free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference\nwas noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.\n\n5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any\ngiven RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it\non the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.\nPumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| Dave Tharp                      | DoD #0751   | \"You can't wear out       |\n| davet@interceptor.CDS.TEK.COM   | MRA #151    |   an Indian Scout,        |\n| '88 K75S  '48 Indian Chief      | AHRMA #751  |  Or its brother the Chief.|\n| '75 R90S(#151) '72 TR-2B(#751)  | AMA #524737 |  They're built like rocks |\n| '65 R50/2/Velorex  '57 NSU Max  |             |   to take the knocks,     |\n|       1936 BMW R12              | (Compulsive | It's the Harleys that     |\n| My employer has no idea.        |   Joiner)   |   give you grief.\"        |\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

The word harass means to \nirritate or torment persistently; I'd hardly consider one time to fall\nunder the definition of persistent.  Additionally, there is no basis\nto assume the behaviour is unwanted, unlike an illegal proposition.\n>\n>> Of course, I think the original question of offering money for sex is\n>> inarguably harrassment, because the activity is illegal, and could be\n>> presumed to be unwanted by the average citizen.\n>\n>I have to take issue with this viewpoint... given that (a) prostitution\n>is a victimless crime and (b) there are literally millions of Americans\n>who participate in some sort of victimless activities which the state\n>has defined to be criminal (e.g., prostitution, obscenity, gambling,\n>using certain recreational drugs, having non-mercenary sex with persons\n>not one's spouse in certain states, having \"unnatural\" sex with people\n>regardless of marital status or exchange of money in certain states,\n>etc.), I'd have to say that the idea that an activity may be presumed to\n>be unwanted by the average citizen merely because it is illegal is the\n>sort of sophistry that only a judge could indulge in with a straight\n>face.

What you say is true, but\nthe law, in order to make what little sense it manages to make, has to\nmake *some* assumptions.  Assuming that an illegal activity is unwanted\nby the average citizen I think is reasonable.  Certainly, I would need\na preponderance of evidence on the side of the propositioner that there\nwas a reasonable belief that the proposition was welcome.\n\nThe number of people who participate in \"victimless\" crimes notwithstanding,\nthe fact reamins that under the law, the activity is illegal.  To presume\nthat the proposition *is* welcome simply because a large number of people\nindulge in it is the type of sophistry only a lawyer could indulge in\nwith a straight face.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n...Dale Cook    \"Any town having more churches than bars has a serious\n                   social problem.\" ---Edward Abbey\nThe opinions are mine only (i.e., they are NOT my employer's)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

Ideally, something that is geared toward \nhobbyists:  small quantity, mail order, etc.\n\nFor years, we've been buying them from a distributor (Marshall) by the\nhundreds for PMP kits.  But orders have dropped to the point where we can\nno longer afford to offer this service.  And all of the distributors I've\nchecked have some crazy minimum order ($100, or so).\n\nI'd like to find a source for those still interested in building PMP kits.\nAny suggestions?\n\n-- \nAndrew C.

EDT\n             \n             \n             THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  My voice is coming to\nyou this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio\nstation in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to\nmeet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,\nhealth care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly\nbroadcast with the American people. \n             \n             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when\nit reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past\nseven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with\nthe people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus\ntour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last\nyear's campaign.\n             \n             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with\nyou, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and\nwhat I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting\nto you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.\n             \n             You sent me to Washington to get our government and\neconomy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad\nexperiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important\nit is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do\nbusiness.  \n             \n             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations\nrise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness\nof their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the\ncooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,\nlabor and government.  Although many of the economies of the\nindustrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've\nmade many of the smart investments and the tough choices which\nour government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them\nhave been moving ahead and too many of our people have been\nfalling behind.\n             \n             We have an economy today that even when it grows is\nnot producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation\nby four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to\nshow for it.  We know that wages of most working people have\nstopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks\nand that too many families can no longer afford the escalating\ncost of health care.\n             \n             But we also know that, given the right tools, the\nright incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and\nbusinesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy\nneeds to expand opportunity and to make our communities better\nplaces to live.\n             \n             In many critical products today Americans are the\nlow cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that\nwe create more of those kinds of jobs.\n             \n             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for\nlong-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old\npriorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to\nbe -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs\nand education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the\nwaste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious\nresources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the\ngroundwork for robust economic growth in the future.\n             \n             These new directions passed the Congress in record\ntime and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our\ncountry.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would\ncreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private\nsector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It\nnow has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. \nBut it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the\nSenate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know\nwould result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.\n             \n             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. \nMillions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and\ncounting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill\nhas been grounded by gridlock.  \n             \n             I know the American people are tired of business as\nusual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin\nor wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have\ntaken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra\nmile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25\npercent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  \n             \n             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million\nAmericans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill\nlanguish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean\nhundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to\nact to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking\nthis initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I\nthink we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant\nportion of our original goals.\n             \n             First, we want to keep the programs as much as\npossible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,\nincluding highway and road construction, summer jobs for young\npeople, immunization for children, construction of waste water\nsites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding\nfor extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who\nhave been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't\ncreating jobs.\n             \n             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs\nin the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40\npercent.\n             \n             And third, I've recommended a new element in this\nprogram to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against\ncrime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire\npolice officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put\nthem back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight\nfor a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it\nand deserve it.\n             \n             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --\nthe Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it\nincreases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this\nyear that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,\ndoesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more\nthan paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this\nbudget is well within the spending limits already approved by the\nCongress this year.\n             \n             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators\nwho are filibustering the bill voted during the previous\nadministration for billions of dollars of the same kind of\nemergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the\nAmerican people to work.  \n             \n             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered\na plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities\nare -- on people or on politics.  \n             \n             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar\nfor dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the\nsoundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our\nchildren.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs\nand investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of\nus when we've helped make more American partners working to\nensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.\n             \n             You know, if every American who wanted a job had\none, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this\ncountry today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first\nstep to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country\nagain.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid\nfor over the life of our budget.\n             \n             Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how\nimportant the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.\n             \n             Good morning, and thank you for listening.\n\n                               END                 10:11 A.M. EDT\n\n\n\n",

I'm not going to apologize for pointing out\nthat your straw-man argument was a straw-man argument.  Nor for saying\nthat your list of \"bible contradictions\" shows such low standards of\nscholarship that it should be an embarrassment to anti-inerrantists,\njust as Josh McDowell should be an embarrassment to the fundies.  Nor\nfor objecting various times to your taking quotes out of context.  Nor\nfor pointing out that \"they do it too\" is not an excuse. Nor for calling\nyour red herrings and smoke screens what they are.\n\nI'm still not sure why you think I'm a hypocrite.  It's true that I\nhaven't responded to any of Robert Weiss' articles, which may be due in\npart to the fact that I almost never read his articles.  But I have\nresponded to both you and Frank DeCenso (a fundie/inerrantist.)  Both\nyou and Frank have taken quotes out of context, and I've objected to\nboth of you doing so.  I've criticized bad arguments both when they\nwere yours and I agreed with the conclusion (that the Bible is not\ninerrant), and when they were Frank's and I disagreed with the\nconclusion.  I've criticized both you and Frank for evading questions,\nand for trying to \"explain me away\" without addressing the objections\nI raise (you by accusing me of being hypocritical and irrational, Frank\nby accusing me of being motivated by a desire to attack the Bible.) I\ndon't see that any of this is hypocritical, nor do I apologize for it.\n\nI do apologize, however, for having offended you in any other way.\n\nHappy now?\n\ndj\n",

After a nice, long rant about how\npeople need to take personal responsibility for their economic and\nsocial lives, all of a sudden 1960's radicals (such as me, I guess)\nare responsible for poor people's lifestyles?  Tell me how that\nworks--or do you think that poor people are just too dumb to think\nfor themselves?\n\nThere are many reasons for the disintegration of the family and\nsupport systems in general among this nation's poor.  Somehow I\ndon't think Murphy Brown--or Janis Joplin--is at the top of any \nsane person's list.\n\nYou want to go after my generation's vaunted cultural revolution for\na lasting change for the worse, try so-called \"relevant\" or \"values\"\neducation.  Hey, it seemed like a good idea at the time.

He must have been abused by a man and is\n] living his life in an attempt to vilify all men who like sex with other men\n] something slightly similar to the way his assailant liked it with him. He\n] will alter or misrepresent anything he finds to try to prove that there are\n] homosexuals who wish to rape little boys like he was coming out of the\n] woodwork. There is no hope for him. In all probability he is secretly gay,\n] which compounds his neurosis in his own mind, by thinking that someone else\n] made him that way. I don't personally see how someone like him could walk\n] and chew gum at the same time, as mentally crippled and dominated as he is\n] by his fantasies.\n] \n] He would have you believe that the figures on the percentage of people who\n] like to do it with the same sex sometime or all the time is way smaller\n] than it is, but then he will virtually assert that everyone's queer and\n] they're trying to get him. He actually believes, despite all evidence that\n] homosexuals do some huge disproportionate amount of child sexual abuse,\n] even though he insists that there may be as few as 1% of them in the male\n] population! If there were that few of them in the population, San Francisco\n] would currently be empty, because a significant portion of them have sought\n] a tolerant atmosphere in that city, and the numbers simply do not work when\n] you add up their home town origins. There is nothing to be gained by\n] communicating with Clayton Cramer, he is unable to listen to anyone.\n] -RSW\n] \n] \n] --\n] * Richard STEVEn Walz   rstevew@deeptht.armory.com   (408) 429-1200  *\n] * 515 Maple Street #1   * Without safe and free abortion women are   *\n] * Santa Cruz, CA 95060    organ-surrogates to unwanted parasites.*   *\n] * Real Men would never accept organ-slavery and will protect Women.  *\n\nSorry, but I don't see how the response applies to what was posted.\n\nUnless I am badly mistaken, Rohit is suggesting that protecting boys\nfrom men is different than protecting girls from men. There are situations\nin which boys and girls are apart from members of the *opposite* sex\n(due to social convention or whatever) and thus are safe (in at least\nsome sense). These same situations don't (necessarily) protect the\nchildren from abuse by members of the *same* sex.\n\nIf we can understand that, it's not such a tremendous leap to suggest\nthat if we all think about it hard, *someone* may come up with a\npractical solution (or even a partial solution) to some of the situations\nin which children are made vulnerable to homosexuals who wish to abuse\nthem. By working together \"with good will on both sides\", we may be\nable to start solving problems without restricting anyone's freedoms.\n\nMr. Walz on the other hand is using Rohit's post as an excuse for\npersonal attacks on Mr. Cramer. While Mr. Walz hasn't (by a *long*\nstretch) been the only one to flame Mr. Cramer, it is no less childish\nand it only serves to weaken any other arguments he may make in the\nfuture.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nRick Roy       Usenet: rick@howtek.MV.com       America Online: QED\nDisclaimer: My employer's views are orthogonal to these.\nThe early bird got worms.\n",

As a \nleft-wing, big government, conventional liberal, I'm just as willing as\nyou are to vote against anti-competitive regulations that favor auto\ndealers.  \n\nBut what I hear from libertarians is a desire to limit incumbents' terms,\nto weaken government by eliminating its power to enforce antitrust laws,\nand a desire to eliminate legislator's pay.  Each strikes me as a \nparticularly ineffective way to insure that auto dealers and other special\ninterests cannot influence public policy.  In fact, they seem clearly\ndesigned to accomplish the opposite.\n\njsh\n>\n>=Mark\n--\nSteve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM   \n\"One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh\n the bulls**t.\" - R.
